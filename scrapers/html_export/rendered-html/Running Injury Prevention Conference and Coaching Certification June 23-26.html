<p>Citing more than a thousand scientific articles and systematic reviews, “New Trends in the Prevention of Running Injuries” questions many current practices in the treatment of both runners and non-runners alike.

<ul>
<li>Injury etiology and theory</li>
<li>Diagnosis and treatment of injury</li>
<li>Planning of training sessions</li>
<li>Evidence based stretching and strength training</li>

<li>Optional group runs with experts in the field</li>
</ul>
<p>The three-day course will enable you to efficiently treat your patients whether they are runners or active in other sports.
