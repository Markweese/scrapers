				<p>When 60 Days of Better began we had planned to have your inspirational stories here and there in our line up. However, we’ve gotten so many stories from those of you who’s lives have been changed that we’ve decided to make them an almost daily occurrence! This email is from Nelson.</p>
<p><em>I had IT band problems for 3 months and i couldn’t run at all, not even a mile. I was rehabbing it all the time: IT rolling, stretching and getting a weekly massage. After 3 months I thought i was better after a PT visit. I tried to run but couldn’t run more than 10 min without pain only 2 months before my Ragnar team. I figured if i ever try a minimal/natural running shoe with the adjoining gait this would be the time so I bought one. My first run in the minimal shoe I went the full lap around the lake, 3 miles, pain free. I tried the traditional shoes and mu knee hurt again, even with an attempted forefoot strike, but put he minimal shoes on the following day and got another lap pain-free. I have been pain free in the IT Band area, even though the slight swelling has not dissipated much, during my runs ever since.</em></p>
<p><em>My next pair will be a Newton Distance shoe.</em></p>
<p><em>Cheers!</em></p>
