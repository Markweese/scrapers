See, my mom was a true flower child and my dad was as free and easy as the Colorado winds… OK we were hippies and dad played drums in a band. Yep that’s me in the sweet pants around Christmas.</p>
<p>We settled down in Raleigh, NC and that’s where I spent most of my youth.  I grew up playing soccer, surfing and swimming. Soccer was my favorite and I ultimately went to college to play. After college, a season ski bumming in Killington and then some more college; I followed my Dad’s footsteps and went into the restaurant/bar industry.  Eventually my wife and I became owners in the industry for over eight years. We had a blast and it was a huge success, but horrible on the midline!</p>
<p>Five years into the biz…. I saw a picture of myself (that I will not share). With the thoughts of<a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tor-Broder-resized-600.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3899" src="https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tor-Broder-resized-600-223x300.png" alt="Tor Broder-resized-600" width="223" height="300" srcset="https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tor-Broder-resized-600-223x300.png 223w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tor-Broder-resized-600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px"></a> having children it was time to make a change. Our ultimate goal was to lead by example and show our kids a healthy way to live. A little time and several pounds later…. It worked! That’s my son Broder and I training for his first 5K.</p>
<p>During that time I had been fulfilling a love for competition with triathlon. This is where  the running comes in… soccer players only run when told. Swimming came naturally, cycling is awesome but running? Ugh. But even not being a runner by trade, it wasn’t long before I developed a passion for the trails and longing to tick off the miles. Running became my favorite discipline.</p>
<p>On a visit to a local triathlon shop I happened to try on a pair of Newtons. They felt amazing  and despite receiving discounted shoes from another brand, I purchased a pair. Not only did they feel great but that end of the season IT band ache disappeared. Needless to say it’s the only shoe I have worn since!</p>
<p>In July 2011 I was able to marry my lifestyle passion with an opportunity at <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com">Newton Running</a>.  As Regional Sales Manager of the Mid-Atlantic I’m able to surround myself with incredibly passionate people and continue to feed that competitive drive.</p>
<p>Many thanks to my wife Carolyn, Lilla and Broder</p>
