				<p>With Thanksgiving under a week away I decided to ask the Newton family what they were thankful for. Often times Thanksgiving can go by just being thought of as a couple days off of work or an excuse to eat a ton of great food. Before you do these well deserved things on your holiday next week, take a second to step back, look around this big beautiful world that we live in and take a look at what you’re thankful for!</p>
