				<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Your new favorite midday smoothie!</strong></p>
<p>A mango, pineapple, ginger, lucuma and almond milk smoothie, concocted by Newton Running Ambassador and Aubergine Restaurant Chef, <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/justin-cogley/"> Justin Cogley</a></p>
<p>In addition to satisfying your sweet tooth, lucuma is gluten-free and a source of antioxidants, fiber, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals necessary for bodily functions and of benefit to the immune system. When mixed with the other ingredients it makes for a great start to your day.</p>
<p>(2 large servings) plus extra</p>
<p>1 cup of peeled diced Mango (ripe!)</p>
<p>1 cup of  peeled diced pineapple</p>
<p>2 peeled frozen bananas (I just keep them chopped up in a ziplock bag)</p>
<p>1 Tsp of Bee pollen</p>
<p>1 Tbsp lucuma powder</p>
<p>1 Tbsp diced ginger root</p>
<p>1 cup Almond milk</p>
<p>*Blend all in a blender and give it a try. Sometimes I will add a few ice cubes to chill it off more and thin it out.</p>
<p>“You can try your own smoothie combinations of course.. but this works for me. –  get creative!” – <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/justin-cogley/">Justin Cogley</a></p>
