				<p>Newton Ambassador and Chef, Justin Cogley shares with us a halibut recipe that has a sauce that reminds him of walking around Thailand. He describes this dish as, “super simple, just like some of the street food in Thailand.”</p>
<p><strong>Halibut, Roasted with Hazelnuts, Bok Choy, Cilantro and Ginger.</strong></p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<p><strong><u>Ingredients</u></strong></p>
<p>3/4 cup finely chopped toasted hazelnuts</p>
<p>1/2 cup panko (Dried Breadcrumbs)</p>
<p>1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley (sliced)</p>
<p>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives</p>
<p>4 6-ounce halibut fillets (each about 1 inch thick)</p>
<p>6 tablespoons butter, melted</p>
<p>Lemon wedges</p>
<p><strong><u>Preparation</u></strong></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400°F.</p>
<p>Mix hazelnuts, breadcrumbs, and herbs in small bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Brush each fish fillet with 1 tablespoon melted butter; season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Place fish on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle breadcrumb-herb mixture atop fish, dividing equally and pressing to adhere. Roast fish until just opaque in center, about 8 minutes. If crisper topping desired, preheat broiler and broil fish about 1 minute, watching carefully to prevent burning. Season with lemon juice.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cilantro-ginger sauce</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Ingredients</u></strong></p>
<p>1/2 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves (save the stems, see below*)</p>
<p>1/2 cup packed fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves</p>
<p>2 shallots (diced)</p>
<p>1 large garlic clove</p>
<p>2 teaspoons grated peeled fresh gingerroot</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</p>
<p>2 tablespoons soy sauce</p>
<p>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</p>
<p><strong><u>Preparation</u></strong></p>
<p>Have ready a bowl of ice water. In a small saucepan of boiling water blanch cilantro and parsley 10 seconds and drain in a sieve. Refresh herbs in ice water and drain in sieve. Chop shallots and garlic.</p>
<p>In a small nonstick skillet cook shallots, garlic, ginger root, and cumin, in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until shallots are softened. In a blender purée shallot mixture, herbs, and about a  1/4 cup water, and soy sauce until smooth, about 1 minute, and season with salt and pepper. Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.</p>
<p><strong><u>Bok Choy</u></strong></p>
<p>4 heads of baby bok choy (separated into individual leaves)</p>
<p>Salt</p>
<p>lemon juice</p>
<p><strong><u>Preparation</u></strong></p>
<p>Have ready a bowl of ice water. In a small saucepan of boiling salted water blanch the bok choy leaves for 45 seconds. If plating right away season the bok choy with lemon juice and salt.</p>
<p><strong><u>Plating</u></strong></p>
<p>Add about 2 tablespoons of sauce to the middle of each of 4 plates. Place the fish onto the sauce and add the leaves of bok choy around the side of the fish.</p>
<p>* The cilantro stems have tons of flavor. I like to slice them up, add a touch of olive oil, salt and some lime or lemon juice and make a simple vinaigrette. You can spoon this around the fish before serving also.</p>
<p>* This recipe is also great with roasted cauliflower, salmon, or pork.</p>
