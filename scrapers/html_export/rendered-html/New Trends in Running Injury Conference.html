Insurance companies now are re-evaluating the advice to get fit if it involves running and the subsequent injuries and costs of expensive imaging studies and treatments.</p>
<p>“We need to develop entirely new approaches to running injuries and stop just treating the symptoms. We need to look at what factors are causing the injuries and design easy to evaluate and specific corrections to the causes,” says Mark Cucuzzella MD, an elite Master’s runner, physician, and teacher of healthier running.</p>
