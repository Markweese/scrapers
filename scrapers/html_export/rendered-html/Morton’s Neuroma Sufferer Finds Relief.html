In this case, M.D. of Vancouver, British Columbia, found relief from Morton’s Neuroma with Newton Running shoes. Here’s her story:</p>
<p>“Yesterday while shopping for a new pair of running shoes for my husband, a very cute shoe caught my eye, it was the Newton Terra Momentus. (Newton Running no longer carries the Terra Momentus, but the <a title="Newton Running Store" href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/lady-isaac-s-16" target="_blank">Lady Isaac S </a>is a great alternative!) I asked to try them on and fell in love at first wearing. I have been struggling with Morton’s Neuroma in my right foot for over a year and had reached the point of accepting that I would just have to get used to the pain.</p>
<p>As soon as I tried on the shoe, I realized that the point of contact was at the mid foot, thereby avoiding the metatarsal and the neuroma. I got excited. I took a quick jog outside and got more excited and bought the shoes</p>
<p>I couldn’t wait to get to the gym this morning to give them a real test drive. Sure enough, I could do all the high impact moves that I wasn’t able to do before. The only thing that held me back was my own fitness level rather than the neuroma!”</p>
<p>–M.D.</p>
<p>Individuals that suffer from Morton’s Neuroma have different demands that need to be met. That being said, we can’t recommend a particular model to everyone, but we can say that we’ve had several success stories from people trying out the <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/lady-isaac-s-16">Lady Isaac S</a>, <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/womens-kismet-ii-charcoal">Women’s Kismet II</a>, <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-sir-isaac-s-16">Sir Isaac S</a> and the <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-kismet-ii-white">Men’s Kismet II</a>.</p>
