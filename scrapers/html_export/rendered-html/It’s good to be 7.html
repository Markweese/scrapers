				<h1>The Truth About Newton Running</h1>
<p>Like a carefree first-grader effortlessly bounding across the playground, Newton Running celebrated its 7<sup>th</sup> birthday in late March at the IRONMAN triathlon in Oceanside, California. My co-founder Jerry Lee and I began living a dream the day we started <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com">Newton Running</a>. A dream founded with a revolutionary idea, a small assortment of demo shoes and a resolve to change not only the world of running, but through giving back, perhaps even change the world.</p>

<p>As I reflect on the past seven years, and Newton’s growing place in the running market, I have never been more proud of the direction of our company or inspired by the uplifting daily reminders of the positive impact we’ve had on runners around the globe. Perhaps most gratifying is Newton’s unwavering commitment to a consistent set of innovative beliefs that have guided the company from its earliest days and led so many runners to find a home with the Newton tribe.</p>
<p>At Newton, we believe in:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Helping You Run Better:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">There’s a “Right” way to run. This doesn’t mean all runners run alike or that you must run a certain way to enjoy running or the unique benefits of Newton running shoes. Simply that the best-practice fundamentals of posture, position and cadence apply to us all. And when followed, they lead to healthier more efficient running. </span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Every runner can run better. Did you know that running form drills are a standard part of the training regimens for most of the elite athletes who work with Newton? We learn to swim, to ride a bike, to follow a disciplined training plan. A small focus on the fundamentals of running can yield enormous benefits for us all.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>No other running shoe helps improve your running like a Newton. Our lightweight, level platform and patented <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/technology/">Action/Reaction technology </a>supports better, more efficient running through maximized ground-to-foot energy transmission. There’s nothing else like it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 19.200000762939453px; color: #000000;">The lasting power of personal relationships:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Virtually every Saturday, I lead a group run form clinic out of the Newton Running Lab in Boulder, Colorado. This opportunity to connect with fellow runners as they experience the Newton difference and discover the feel of efficient running is always one of the most rewarding parts of my week. </span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>If you attend a major marathon or IRONMAN expo, chances are good that Jerry Lee or I will be there, usually on our hands and knees fitting customers in shoes. We live for our running community. Personally engaging with new and seasoned runners alike who share our passion is and always will be core to our success.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Our customer service team is on a first-name basis with an impressive list of Newton runners, many of whom have been loyal Newtonites since our 2007 launch and proudly display a closet full of colorful Newtons from virtually every launch. We are so grateful for their loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="line-height: 19.200000762939453px;">In giving back:</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">We founded Newton with the goal of establishing a double bottom line. Profitability supporting the committed team that makes Newton run, while also sharing in our success with those less fortunate, or in crisis. To date Newton has given more than $1.5 million to charitable causes. </span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>From trail clean-ups, to food drives to evenings serving meals to those in need, giving back together bonds our team in unbreakable ways.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 19.200000762939453px;">It’s good to be Seven. Thanks to all of you who have joined us for the ride and here’s to along run into the future.</span></p>
