				<p>We stumbled upon this fun story of a budding (?) relationship from blogger <a href="http://lolarunner.blogspot.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://lolarunner.blogspot.com/', 'Lola Runs');" target="_blank">Lola Runs</a>, who is chronicling her adventures in the world of online dating on her blog. LolaRuns’s second date with ‘BoyGenius’ turns into a discussion of natural running form and Newton Running shoes. Will true love ensue?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LolaRuns goes on a second date with BoyGenius</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">One day after LolaRuns first date with BoyGenius, BoyGenius text LolaRuns to request a second date. A second date would be lovely LolaRuns responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">Throughout the week, leading up to the date schedule for Friday, November 13, BoyGenius and LolaRuns text about BoyGenius’s running program and Newton running shoes. Please recall that LolaRuns hasn’t been running because of a pounding ache in her lower back when she attempts to run. When LolaRuns shared this information with BoyGenius during the first date, he immediately peppered her with questions and concluded that it was her running form that was producing the back problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">Him: “What is your running style? How do you land? Are you a heel striker?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">Me: “I tend to lean back and strike with my heel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">Him: “It’s your running form. You need Newton running shoes. They have a patented technology with exposed grooves that encourages mid to forefront running. Let’s walk over to the Potomac Running store and I will show the shoes to you. You have to strike with your midfoot or forefoot if you want to run healthily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">This is where cute BoyGenius even demonstrated the proper running form while walking on Market Street. LolaRuns was a bit smitten at that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">The texts during the week followed the same vein with questions about LolaRuns workout – the stairclimber for an hour for the past two months – and the new Newton training shoes that would be available in the next month. BoyGenius also encouraged LolaRuns to check out the Newton web site and watch all the videos – which LolaRuns promptly and attentively reviewed. LolaRuns was sold on the Newtons – and quite possibly on BoyGenius.</span></p>

I don’t know about you, but I’m sure rooting for BoyGenius!</p>
