<p><strong>Staying Nutritionally on Track while Traveling<br>
By: Dr. Amanda Stevens; Professional Triathlete<br>
</strong><br>
You’ve put in the hard work and mileage for your next race and are excited for your upcoming<br>
race adventure. A lot of times you have improved your nutritional choices, either consciously or<br>
subconsciously, throughout your training and preparation. But as race week and travel<br>
approaches, this is one of the most often overlooked factors to your success on race day. For<br>
me, I’ve got several food allergies/sensitivities along with being Celiac, so I have to be super<br>
careful with food choices while on the road. I’ve found that the biggest factor in determining<br>
your ‘success’ is planning ahead! Here are my top tips while traveling.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Keep your diet as close to what is ‘normal’ for you in the week leading up to the race.<br>
Hopefully this is a balanced diet full of LOTS of healthy fats, low-to-moderate carbs, and<br>
sufficient protein, coming from whole/real food choices with minimal (if any) processed<br>
foods.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Either book accommodations on websites like VRBO or Airbnb that offer kitchens or hotels<br>
that have a fridge/microwave or kitchenette. If you are a ‘foodie’ and want to explore local<br>
food options, save ‘experimental’ foods until after the race by sticking with tried and true<br>
options in the days leading up to the race.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Travel with a few items that can help with food prep. My suitcase generally has more<br>
kitchen items in it than clothes! Here’s what I pack: Ninja Express Chopper/Blender, Mini-<br>
Rice Cooker (can be used not only for rice/quinoa but also for eggs, steaming veggies,<br>
‘grilling’ chicken or other proteins, and more), Palm Peeler, Measuring Spoons, Knife and<br>
cutting board, travel can opener, ziplock bags and steamer bags (awesome in a pinch when<br>
your only option is the microwave), and camping bowl, plate, and silverware as they are<br>
lightweight and collapsable to take up minimal suitcase space. I also usually throw in a few<br>
spices in small jewelry sized bags.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Race Day Food. Whatever you are planning to eat for breakfast and during the race…be<br>
sure it is in your suitcase, as there is no guarantee your destination will have exactly what<br>
you want.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Comfort Foods. For me this is my favorite chocolates. For Randy…coffee!</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Travel Food. The biggest obstacle here is getting your food through TSA security without<br>
anything getting confiscated. I have an awesome Food Bag by PackIt that is freezable and<br>
TSA approved. I fill this up with travel day snacks and any other ‘must-haves’ for the trip<br>
that require refrigeration. I’ve also got a set of camping silverware that is more durable than<br>
plastic silverware and is allowed through security too. If you have something that is liquid,<br>
semi-solid, or gel/paste-like there are a few way to ensure it passes the security scrutiny.<br>
Carry it in individual serving packets (ex: nut butters, chia/flax seeds); use several travel<br>
containers that are 3.4oz or smaller, or you can freeze so it’ll be solid going through the<br>
scanner and will thaw out along the way (coconut water; butter (yep, I always travel with<br>
butter!); coconut oil). Its always a good idea to throw in a few empty ziplock freezer bags<br>
that you can fill will ice once through security.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> If driving in a car, pack a cooler. Most of the time we go into auto-pilot and try to reach are<br>
destination as fast as possible (you just have to beat the GPS arrival time, right?!)…but<br>
taking a few extra minutes to drive an extra mile or two off the exit, can give you much better<br>
options than gas stations and fast food. Grocery stores and mini-marts come in quite handy.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Hydration. Take an empty water bottle and/or Tumbler. Fill up with water before getting on<br>
the plane. You can even take tea bags and make some hot tea on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> A few suggestions for travel food: Nuts/Seeds; Nut/Seed Butters; Avocados, Hard Boiled<br>
Eggs, Fresh/Frozen Fruit, Veggies and Hummus, Whole Food and/or Fruit Bars, Baby Food<br>
Pouches, Lunchmeat, Pre-Made Salad/Wrap, and Leftovers.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Post-race: Celebrate and Treat Yourself to something special and savor the local flavors!</p>
<p>Happy Running!</p>
