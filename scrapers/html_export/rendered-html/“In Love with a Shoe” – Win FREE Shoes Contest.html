In the email Cassy included the lyrics to a song she wrote about her Newtons. This is definitely the most fun, creative testimonial we’ve received yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ode to my Newton Training Shoes</strong></span><br>
(To the tune of Gavin De Graw’s song “In Love With A Girl”)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So many shoes gonna look like they want you,</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"> Try to get you thinking they’re really fast.<br>
But there’s nothing like the fit of the one that has put in the time<br>
And you know its gonna be there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">Back your forefoot when no other shoe does it,<br>
Don’t let nobody slow you down, when your fast.<br>
There’s no pain in protecting your pace,<br>
From the 5 to the Tri to the runners high.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">I’m in love with a shoe who knows me better,<br>
Fell for the color just when I met her.<br>
Took my sweet time when I was at the store,<br>
Newton understands…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">And you know how to treat my toes right,<br>
Not too loose and not too tight.<br>
Helps me to soar when I’m in flight.<br>
Newton understands me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">I’m in love with a shoe (I’m in love with).<br>
I’m in love with a shoe (I’m in love with).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">Out the many aching arches and squashed toes,<br>
Through the valley of the love of the mesh,<br>
Is a support that is there for the soles,<br>
Falling down on the road without leaving any down lows.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">But you’re high from the ride of a lifetime.<br>
The moment was over too fast,<br>
Then its home to plan the next run,<br>
The shoes will have a long life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">I’m in love with a shoe who knows me better,<br>
Fell for the color just when I met her.<br>
Took my sweet time when I was at the store,<br>
Newton understands…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">And you know how to treat my toes right,<br>
Not too loose and not too tight.<br>
Helps me to soar when I’m in flight.<br>
Newton understands me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">I’m in love with a shoe (I’m in love with).<br>
I’m in love with a shoe (I’m in love with).</span></p>
