Instead of a shoe feature, we are going to drop some Newton Company knowledge on you. Have you ever wondered about the little “B” in the bottom corner of your shoe box? That is a B Corporation Certification symbol. Newton Running was the first Running Shoe Company to become B Corp certified. This initiative influences everything we do from our packaging that is made entirely of recycled materials, to the practices at our Headquarters of composting and bicycle commuting (not at the same time. We live dangerously, but not that dangerously). So what does all of this mean? Glad you asked! Here is the Cliffs Notes version to becoming B Corp certified, and what it means for Newton. And you- the Newtonites.</p>
<p>To become B Corp certified, Newton had to complete an assessment that addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governance and transparency</li>
<li>Environmental Responsibility</li>
<li>Community Responsibility</li>
<li>Employee Treatment</li>
</ul>

Newton will have to repeat the assessment every two years. The process becomes more rigorous with every recertification. It is B Corp’s method for pushing companies to make ongoing incremental improvement</p>
