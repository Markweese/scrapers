It took me about a month to transition to my new Newton shoes. Since then, my racing delta has changed from about 7:45 to 7:10 minute miles, with less expenditure of energy. These shoes have totally changed my running enjoyment. I think you need a training CD with each shoe sale (<em>ed. note, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/NewtonRunning" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/user/NewtonRunning', 'our videos on YouTube');" target="_blank">our videos on YouTube</a>, with more on the way</em>). I just happened to see a triathlon video on forefoot landing, just before getting your shoes. I would never had made the transition without the video. I believe my best races are ahead of me! My regular running buddies are a little grumpy with me. This has been the easiest way to gauge my running improvement; Iâ€™m now running with the next fastest group!<br>
