<p><i>Brent and Kyle Pease are a team of brothers from Atlanta Georgia who compete together in athletic competitions — despite the fact that Kyle is relegated to a wheelchair, the result of Cerebral Palsy at birth. Brent, his older brother, pushes, pedals and paddles Kyle in 5k’s, 10k’s, marathons and triathlons to encourage those who witness their efforts that anything is possible. Through their foundation, </i><a href="http://www.kylepeasefoundation.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kylepeasefoundation.org/', 'The Kyle Pease Foundation');"><i>The Kyle Pease Foundation</i></a><i>, the duo raise funds to promote success for persons with disabilities by providing assistance to meet their individual needs through sports.  </i></p>

<p><i>The following is from Kyle Pease’s blog: Where There is a Wheel There’s a Way:</i></p>
<p>I’ve been finding it difficult to fall asleep at night knowing that everything that Brent and I have been working toward is just around the corner. Up until this point, the greatest moment of our running career occurred recently at the Peachtree 10K, where we became the first assisted pair in the long history of the race to compete. It doesn’t get any better than the local crowds cheering our names as we traveled 6.2 miles through the familiar streets of our hometown Atlanta…or does it?</p>
<p>Now, just two months later, Brent and I will make Pease history as we try to have the word “Ironman” etched next to our names. For this, we will cover 140.6 miles through the water and roadways of rural Madison, Wisconsin — 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles on the bike, and finishing with the 26.2 mile marathon. Our goal is to break the 17-hour mark, which of course would make us forever IRONMEN. But even though Brent and I are hoping for a time between 14 and 16 hours, I’ll be honest anything this side of 16:59:59 is good enough. But that one second, is the second that differentiates an Ironman from a couple of guys who competed to truly becoming Ironmen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4362" alt="601356_690503014308926_868084656_n" src="https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n.jpg" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n.jpg 640w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n-624x936.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></p>
<p>Now, as strange as some people find it, I have been training harder than I ever have in my life. Many people think that I have the easy part. Although Brent may agree with them while he’s paddling, pedaling and pushing me for 140.6 miles, it is important for me to be prepared for this, too. I have never sat on a bike for nearly nine hours and the average human body is not likely to fare well without proper preparation. Brent and I are training far longer and more often than we normally do in order to get both of our bodies used to the many miles and hours out on the course. I’ve been eating better than I normally do and have been trying to increase my liquid intake. I’m struggling a bit there, as I don’t really enjoy drinking water, but it’s very important to stay hydrated. It would be a shame if Brent was up to the task, but I wasn’t. It’s important to me to not let my brother and my teammate down.</p>
<p>My trainer, Matthew Rose, (yes I have a trainer) tells me to visualize the shoot. The thought of 45,000 screaming fans lining the shoot at the end of the race is something I just can’t imagine, despite his efforts to help me mentally imagine what it will be like. That is the golden carrot hanging just in front of me that will motivate and inspire me and subsequently inspire Brent to the finish line.</p>
<p>Yet, there’s one very important thing for my readers and our fans to remember, becoming an Ironman is not and never will be for or about Brent and me. It’s about our Foundation and the people who we are hoping to inspire: People who see what we are about to accomplish and believe that anything is possible through our efforts.</p>
<p>We are very proud of the Kyle Pease Foundation and take great pleasure in seeing the looks on the faces of the athletes who compete with us. It is exciting to know that through the efforts of a few, we have impacted the lives of many. Although Brent and I will be thrilled to wear the Ironman medal around our necks on the evening of September 8th, we really know that the medal symbolically hangs from the necks of all those friends, fans, athletes and sponsors of the Kyle Pease Foundation. We know that through their continued inspiration and efforts that the only thing that will not be humanly possible is finishing in a second more than 16:59:59. Off to Wisconsin!</p>
