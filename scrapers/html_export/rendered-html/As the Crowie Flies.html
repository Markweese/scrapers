<p>Two weeks ago at Ruby Hill Park in Denver, Ironman World Champion and Boulder resident (for the northern summer at least) Craig Alexander met with the Rocky Mountain Triathlon Club for a meet and greet.  Newton founder, Danny Abshire spoke with the group about the dynamics of midfoot running, and how Newton Running shoes can be an asset.  Also sponsoring the event was Runner’s Roost in Denver, who showed up with a van full of Newton shoes to try on and sell.  The night was capped off with a team run with Craig leading the way as they did hill repeats – a great turnout and a great night for all.</p>
