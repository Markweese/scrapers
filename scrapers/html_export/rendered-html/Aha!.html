<p>For Newtonites, there’s a uniquely memorable moment when the unmistakable pop that characterizes the Newton ride first energized our stride. Nearly a decade ago, before terms like “minimalist” and “natural” invaded running vocabulary, Newton founders Danny Abshire and Jerry Lee spent years perfecting that feel. Danny and Jerry knew “it” when they felt “it”, launching the Newton brand and an ever-evolving product line that has always stayed true to that trademark experience.</p>
<p>The Newton ride is different. It transcends shoe technology and running form to simply make every run better. So that “aha” moment reappears every time you lace up your Newtons. In celebration of all that differentiates us, from our characteristic colors to our protruding lugs, we launch our new Newton brand campaign.</p>
<p>Hello better!</p>
