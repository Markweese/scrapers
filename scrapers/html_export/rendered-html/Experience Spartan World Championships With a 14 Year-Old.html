				<p>I sat on the steep hillside with a 5-gallon bucket of gravel between my legs, protecting it from spilling. This was just a temporary stop to collect my strength as I climbed up the Killington, Vermont ski run. It was a brutal reminder that ski slopes are for skiing down and that is it! This same obstacle was my biggest challenge at my first Spartan Beast several months ago in Utah. The sight of a bucket now makes me cringe. Descending the hillside, with my bucket in my arms, I thought I might actually cry. As I dumped my gravel into the bin at the end, successfully completing the obstacle, I said to myself, “Pull yourself together, you still have a long way to go.”</p>

<p><b>Show Time</b></p>
<p>I had no idea this race would be so hard. Standing at the start line, I felt welcomed amongst my new Spartan family. I appreciated the cheers and well wishes from my fellow racers as my name was called to the start line of the Spartan World Championships. I found myself standing amongst some of the world’s greatest athletes. There were Olympians from around the globe as well as Xterra, USTAF and Trail World Champions, Professional Obstacle Course Racers, Adventure Racers, triathletes and marathon winners. This talented group of athletes, including the Spartan Pro Team, will be featured in the NBC Sports Network TV special about the World Championships on October 19th.</p>
<p>Given Spartan’s history and the presence of NBC TV, most of us assumed we were about to embark on the toughest, most grueling 13-mile course ever designed by Spartan. Little did we know how humbling the day would be—the steep climbs, cold water and grueling course would sideline even some of the world’s most fit athletes.</p>
<p><b>Climbing &amp; Descending</b></p>
<p>The first part of the course was mainly a steep never-ending trail climb up the hills of Killington Ski Resort. I was happy with my selection of running this course in <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com">Newton Running shoes</a>. (The Distance Elites to be exact.) I knew there would be a lot of serious climbing so I chose to stay on the lighter side with my shoes. I had done my last Spartan Beast in my Newton All-weathers. The unique lug design of Newton shoes is not only great for forefoot running but also provides great traction on these difficult courses. Spartans were once again falling, slipping and sliding on the steep descents and I was able to keep my footing. There were a few walls and round hay bails to climb on our way up, which is always fun.</p>

<p>Living and training at 7,000 feet in Park City, UT, as well as only carrying 98 pounds on my small frame, was a great advantage on the first part of the course. I was surprised to find myself hanging with many of the elite females for the first six to seven miles. It was only when we encountered the heavy obstacles, that their more adult bodies became a huge advantage for them.</p>
<p><b>Two-thirds My Weight</b></p>
<p>Upon reaching one of the few black diamond ski runs at Killington, I peered up the steep slope.  As far up the mountain as I could see, it was just a stream of racers carrying something. As I approached a pile of sandbags, I quickly realized there was only one size. Many of the weighted obstacles at Spartan Races have female and male sized weights. This was the World Championships, though, what was I thinking. There was no time to stop and think. This was a race!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4510" src="https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry-1024x685.jpg" alt="Spartan Vermont Beast World Championships 2013-60#sandbag carry" width="625" height="418" srcset="https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry-624x417.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></p>
<p>As a competitive athlete, you learn to improvise as you go. I wasn’t sure how I would handle this heavy obstacle but knew I just had to get moving with it. I grabbed my sandbag, tossed it up onto my back and began the long trek. I would alternate carrying the weight on one shoulder, then the other. When both shoulders got fatigued, I would place it evenly across my upper back and neck.  The one thought I had the entire time was, “Why is a 14-year-old girl carrying what a grown man is carrying?” At the time, I had no idea I was carrying 60 pounds, literally two-thirds my body weight. All I knew was, “It was heavy”.  It was only after the race, that I had learned the actual weight we were all carrying.</p>
<p><b>Burpees &amp; Perseverence</b><b></b></p>
<p>The Hercules Hoist gave me my first set of burpees. A cement bucket is hooked to a pulley system.  You must use a rope to pull the bucket up to the top. As I started to hoist the bucket up, I would quickly find myself being pulled up in the air as the bucket returned to the ground. “You got to be kidding me! I’ve done this before. This cement bucket must be heavier than my last race.” After being lifted off the ground several times and only getting the weight half way up, I realized Hercules would win today. I immediately started doing my 30 burpees.</p>

<p>During the entire race I was reminded, “I had it easy.” I was not carrying a tumor, like my new friend, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auM8kK7qblg" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auM8kK7qblg', 'Iram Leon');">Iram Leon</a>. He is 32 years old and living with an inoperable brain tumor, yet not letting it slow him down. I had two healthy legs unlike the amputee that crawled up the entire Killington ski slope on his hands and knees or like the female amputee who stood at the start line with me. I was able to just be at the event, unlike <a href="http://teamwinter.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://teamwinter.org/', 'my dad');">my dad</a> and many others that left this world too soon. It wasn’t hard to put my pain aside and persevere.</p>
<p>Having previewed the course the day before, I knew the water obstacles would come at miles seven and ten. Seeing all the water on this course, I also knew I wanted a shoe that had great drainage, not one that would hold water. I had poured water in my Newton trainers prior to the race to see how quickly it would drain out. Unlike many Spartans, I was not intimidated by the water, but rather excited. As a two-time triathlon <a href="http://wintervinecki.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://wintervinecki.com/', 'national champion,');">national champion,</a> I had been battling it out in the water since I was five years old. I didn’t take into account, however, how much wearing shoes affected your ability to swim. I was especially glad I didn’t wear a hydration pack like so many did. It would have been yet another thing to weigh me down as I swam across the frigid water and climbed up the rope climbs.</p>
<p><b>Tarzan &amp; The Tyrolean Traverse</b><b></b></p>
<p>The Tarzan Swing was nearly impossible! I heard of only one female who made it successfully across. This obstacle consisted of ladders and ropes suspended from a bridge in the middle of a lake. After swimming out and climbing up to the top of the bridge, there were about five or six little ropes. One had to swing across these ropes to get to the bell. I made it across two ropes then fell about ten feet into the lake.  As I swam to shore, my only thought was, “I think I’m turning into an ice cube.” As I crawled onto shore, it was burpee time again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4503" src="https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire-1024x685.jpg" alt="Spartan Vermont Beast World Championships 2013-barb wire" width="625" height="418" srcset="https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire-624x417.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></p>
<p>Next up, the Tyrolean Traverse. Imagine a rope suspended across water; a kids dream, an adult’s nightmare! I may have moved slower than Sid, the two-toed sloth, but I made it! I hung below the rope with just my knees and elbows draped over the long rope that spanned the freezing cold, irrigation pond for the ski resort. There was no way I was going to fall off that rope, swim to shore, do 30 burpees and then have to reattempt it again. It was pretty intimidating seeing Elite men wrapped in a foil blanket at the edge of the water, hypothermic and unable to continue on. Today, the Tyrolean Rope would separate the winners from the losers. All I could think was, “Just hang on!” I have some great rope burns on my arms to show for my effort.</p>

<p><b>Pushing Beyond</b></p>
<p>The Spartan World Championships pushed me farther, mentally and physically, than I have ever been pushed before. However, with this being said, I know I have not reached my limit. There is always a take home lesson I learn from every race; whether it is a triathlon, a marathon, an aerial skiing competition or a Spartan Race. Spartan reminded me how crucial the mental component of a sport can be. Even if your body wants to give up, you can usually mentally keep pushing on and many times your body will recover. If you give up mentally though, it is over immediately.</p>

<p>For many, crossing the finish line on Saturday was the end of their race weekend. Placing first in the world in the 19 &amp; under open division and 28<sup>th</sup> amongst the elite females was perhaps my greatest accomplishment ever. However, the most important race to me was actually the next day. For the first time, Spartan offered a charity race. Beat up and exhausted but willing to do it all again, my team of five athletes, <a href="http://teamwinter.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://teamwinter.org/', 'Team Winter');">Team Winter</a>, set out Sunday morning to try to capture the Spartan Charity Race Title. Our team raced for the 1 in 6 men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer, the cancer that took my 40 year-old-dad from me when I was only 9-years-old.</p>
<p>We were expected to navigate a two- to three-mile course, with the fastest three times from each team counting. Seeing some of Spartan’s best obstacle course racers smiling at the start line Sunday and getting their “Spartan On” for something bigger than themselves was a great sight. These guys and gals went out with revenge and were ready to give everything they had left for their cause. Although Team Winter took 2<sup>nd</sup> place by only a few seconds, we were proud to stand on the podium as one of the top five teams in the world. Each team took prize money home for their charity and most importantly raised awareness for their cause.</p>

<p>Spartan World Championships was great training as I headed into my sixth marathon on October 12<sup>th</sup> on New Zealand’s Great Barrier Island—my second to last continent on my world marathon tour for prostate cancer awareness. Keep following Newton for my next race report!</p>
<p>Never Give In!</p>
