				<p>Put your cooking skills to the test with Newton Ambassador and Chef, Justin Cogley’s recipe, <strong>Heirloom Tomatoes, Braised Seaweed and Sesame</strong>.</p>
<p>“Since the local tomato season is starting to wind down, here is a great way to enjoy them.  You can make the sauce, braised seaweed and vinaigrette the day before and use them for a number of different applications.”</p>
<p>Serves 4.</p>
<p>4 large Heirloom tomatoes for serving</p>
<p><strong><u>Heirloom Tomato Sauce</u></strong></p>
<p>1/4 cup red onion, sliced</p>
<p>1 garlic glove, chopped</p>
<p>2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p>2 large heirloom tomatoes chopped (I used a yellow variety)</p>
<p>1/4 cup water</p>
<p>2 tbsp vinegar, balsamic, quince, raspberry or red wine vinegar.</p>
<p>salt and pepper</p>
<p>Sweat the onions and garlic in the olive oil for about 5 min over low heat until they soften. Next add the tomatoes, water and vinegar. Cook for about 30 minutes, until the liquid is slightly reduced.  Transfer to a blender and blend to combine. Strain through a strainer into a container, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p><strong><u>For The Braised Seaweed</u></strong></p>
<p>1 cup dried hijiki or wakame seaweed</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</p>
<p>1 tablespoon sake</p>
<p>1 tablespoon sugar</p>
<p>2 to 3 tablespoons soy sauce</p>
<p>Soak the hijiki in warm water to cover for 15 to 20 minutes, or until soft. It will expand to many times its original volume, so choose a 2-quart bowl. Reserve 1 cup of the liquid and drain off the rest. Pat away the excess moisture with paper towels.</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a skillet, preferably nonstick, over high heat. Add the hijiki and quickly saute, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. When it becomes aromatic, add the sake and toss the contents of the skillet until the sake evaporates. Add 1/2 cup of the stock and lower the heat to maintain a steady, gentle simmer. Partially cover the pan, swirling the pan occasionally in circular motions to ensure even cooking. Check the level of liquid, adding stock or water to keep the food from scorching. Cook 5 to 6 minutes, or until nearly all the liquid is gone. Add the sugar and the remaining 1/2 cup stock and continue to cook uncovered for 6 to 7 minutes, or until nearly all the liquid is gone. Test a piece of hijiki. It should give easily when pinched. If it does not, add a few spoonfuls of water and continue to simmer until tender. Do not add any soy sauce until the hijiki is tender.</p>
<p>Add 2 tablespoons soy sauce and cook uncovered 1 to 2 minutes, or until the liquid is nearly gone. Taste and balance any unwanted sweetness by adding a few drops more soy sauce.</p>
<p>Remove the pan from the heat and let the hijiki mixture cool. This is best served at room temperature.</p>
<p><strong><u>For the Sesame dressing </u></strong></p>
<p>3 Tbsp rice vinegar</p>
<p>2 Tbsp dark sesame oil</p>
<p>1 Tbsp canola or light olive oil</p>
<p>splash of soy sauce</p>
<p>2 Tbsp sesame seeds</p>
<p>Mix all together to form a broken vinaigrette. Taste seasoning.</p>
<p><strong><u>For Serving</u></strong></p>
<p>Take the ripe Heirloom Tomatoes, slice them each into 4 slices. Next, season with sea salt and pepper and place 4 slices to a plate. Spoon some of the tomato sauce around the plate and then top the tomatoes with the seaweed, herbs, and flowers. Finally spoon some of the dressing around the plate.</p>
<p>Optional:  Add to this salad some nori sheets cut up into squares, some cherry tomatoes, pea shoots, chervil, and a few edible flowers. You could also serve with sliced avocado!</p>

				<p><strong>An ultramarathon is any footrace longer than the traditional marathon length of 26.2 miles. We asked our Newton athletes what it takes for them to conquer the distance. </strong></p>
<h2><strong>PAM REED</strong></h2>
<p><em>Pam is one of the top athletes (male or female) in the history of American ultra-distance running. She is also an accomplished triathlete, regularly competing in Ironman races. Pam ran marathons and 10Ks exclusively until 1991, when she moved up to the ultramarathon distance. Since then, she has completed more than 90 ultramarathon events winning multiple titles in trail, road and track ultras, including two overall victories at the Badwater Ultramarathon, a 135-mile endurance run in Death Valley, CA.</em></p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-5532"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-pam.jpg"" alt=""blog-image-pam"" width=""720"" height=""450"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-pam.jpg 720w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog-image-pam-300x188.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px""></p>
<p><em><strong>What does your training look like?</strong></em></p>
<p>My weekly mileage is between 70 to 90 miles of running per week. I run Monday- Friday with friends at 5:30AM and add on a second run each week day, totaling a minimum of ten miles per day. On the weekends, I head out for nine mile runs Saturday and Sunday morning.  In place of traditional speed work I run a variety of distances including marathons one to two times per month. I swim about five miles per week and bike 70 to 100 miles per week, weather permitting.  I also add in hot yoga seven hours per week.</p>
<p>I have been running long distance and doing Ironman Triathlons since 1991 and in that time I have never had a coach or used a heart rate monitor.  I just now started using a watch to see how far I have gone. I plan to try my watch at Zion 100 in a couple of weeks so we will see if it lasts the whole time.  Hopefully I can run fast enough so it lasts.</p>
<p>For the most part I listen to my body.  If I am breathing hard I slow down.  When I am thirsty I drink and when I am hungry I eat.</p>
<p><em><strong>What about nutrition?</strong></em></p>
<p>I am not the best at nutrition. I eat steak the night before a race and use Carbo Pro with GU Roctane pills during a race. My go-to weekly fuel comes down to oatmeal, soup, potatoes, peanut butter and a Starbucks shot of espresso. In an Ironman, I‘ll eat a sandwich on the bike and GUs on the run. In 50k’s and 50 milers I eat some regular food and do some GUs.  In 100’s I almost always do real food: Peanut Butter Sandwiches, potatoes, oatmeal, tomato soup, ginger beer, club soda, Starbucks double shot of espresso, hot tea, coffee, coke, mountain dew and pancakes.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your upcoming races?</strong></em></p>

<h2><strong>VAN MCCARTY</strong></h2>
<p><em>Van took up endurance sports in college (1990’s) racing bicycles. He then transitioned to triathlons in 2001 (31 years of age) and he quickly found running to be his strength…and the most fun to boot! He did his first Ironman in 2005 (Coeur d’Alene). Van competes in road marathons, trail ultras, and triathlons. Van is typically able to compete with the top of the field,, but has come to terms that besting the Masters is more a reality than hanging with the fast 20 and 30 year olds!</em></p>

<p><em><strong>What does your training look like?</strong></em></p>
<p>My typical running week ranges between 50-75 miles unless I am tapering pre or post-race, then I drop down to 50-60 miles. A standard week for me consists of 7-8 hours running, 12-14 hours cycling, and &lt;2 hours in the pool. Keep in mind that I am a triathlete, so my run volume is a little low compared to “runners only.”</p>
<p>I always run with a Garmin, but only analyze it when I have a structured workout. I tend to run by feel and effort.  What I find valuable is the Milestone POD.  I like seeing the foot strike, cadence, and stance time the device records.  This helps to improve running for and injury prevention.</p>
<p><em><strong>What about nutrition?</strong></em></p>
<p>My nutrition has evolved over 20 years of trial and error. It may not work for everyone.</p>
<p>Nutrition while Training: I tend to complete my workouts on the bare minimum of nutrition.  I like to use reserves in training to help the body access fat stores for energy.  For morning workouts, I drink coffee, and usually nothing else.  Post workouts  I drink PhysioPhyx recovery drink after hard or long efforts.  For my lunch workouts, do eat a bit in the morning between workouts (fruit, sun butter, bagel, etc).</p>
<p>For long runs over 2 hours, I will take water and gels. That’s about it, not a lot.  Again, PhysioPhyx drink after all long runs and rides.</p>
<p>Nutrition while Racing: Here I will address Ultra Distance (50k-50 mile) nutrition.  Fortunately, most races have adequate aid stations to refuel, although there could be an hour between each station.  If I am doing a 50k, I will run with a hand-held water bottle and fill it with an energy drink at each aid station.  I also aim for a gel every hour while racing. If I am doing a 50 mile, I will grab “food” once or twice, typically a PB&amp;J sandwich or a Clif Bar.  I know there will be plenty of post-race recovery so I never overdo it, I want to avoid over loading the stomach and creating difficulty digesting energy.</p>

<p><em>Meredith has quite the impressive race resume. She once completed in 3 Ironman events in 3 countries on 3 consecutive weekends (Ironman France, Austria, and Switzerland). Additionally, she has completed 12 full Ironman and 12 half Ironman events before switching to ultra-running and ultra-cycling following spinal fusion and reconstruction in 2012. Meredith is also a two-time Furnace Creek 508-mile Bicycle Race finisher.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>What does your training look like?</strong></em></p>
<p>Considering my penchant for undertaking a lot of races in a brief amount of time, I receive a lot of training questions. Personally, I do subscribe to the “race to fitness” theory because I really love testing my nutrition and there is nothing like taking advantage of a supported training day where all of the aid stations will be provided for you. That is a great time to train the same crew you will be using for your “A” race if you are bringing one. They will get to know you and how you like to be crewed, and you will be able to communicate your needs without the stress of the race. As far as day-to-day training, I really enjoy doing three-day blocks not only because my life is extremely busy with my family, coaching and nonprofit responsibilities, but also because when you are training for a very long race, let’s face it, you are going to get tired. Beginning day three of a block consisting of 22 miles on day one, 25 miles on day two and 50k on day three prepares not only your body, but also your brain. Ultra-running is extremely mental, so anything you can do to prepare your mind and trick yourself into believing what you are undertaking is a piece of cake is key!</p>
<p>After these three-day blocks, I take a day off before executing an easy four-mile recovery run followed by a tempo day with some pickups. I’m not an uber high-mileage person to be honest, and rarely hit more than 90 miles a week no matter how long the race I am planning for is. I subscribe to quality, not quantity and try to stay healthy by listening to my body instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about nutrition?</em> </strong></p>
<p>I’ve been extremely lucky to have found a nutrition that really works for me after having a very dicey start to ultra-running. Let’s start with the day before a big race—especially one in extreme heat or stress. During the day, I sip on a very high electrolyte concentrate called <a href=""http://www.therightstuff-usa.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.therightstuff-usa.com/', 'The Right Stuff');"">The Right Stuff</a>, which was formulated originally for NASA astronauts to combat dehydration in space. For dinner, I do not carb load—quite the opposite. I’ve found that the lower my carb intake as I train and race, the fewer stomach issues I have. Basically, I subscribe to the concept of metabolic efficiency; therefore, I eat a piece of salmon, jasmine rice and asparagus the night before while only having two protein-enriched UCAN drinks and a banana for breakfast—even if I might be running for the next 30 hours. The existence of the protein helps curb my appetite and hunger over the long hours ahead since I am not capable of taking in solids while racing.</p>

<p><em><strong>What inspired you to tackle the Antarctica Marathon?</strong></em></p>
<p>I have been running the New York City marathon every year for charity since 1996, ranging from breast cancer to brain cancer and the challenged athletes foundation. I found that donors got a little tired of the same old race, so last year I set 3 races as my goal. I had heard of the ice marathon from a close friend in Switzerland who had done it, so I signed up for it!!</p>
<p><em><strong>How did you train for the extremely cold conditions?</strong></em></p>
<p>I love the cold. I grew up in the mountains in Switzerland and lived in Aspen for three years in the early 90s. Luckily, in January 2014, New York City had a deep cold spell, so I ran a lot outside. I acclimatized well. It is just a matter of layering and keeping moving when outside!</p>
<p><strong><em>What was the most memorable part of the challenge?</em> </strong></p>
<p>From flying from NYC to Santiago to Punta Arenas, meeting the 53 runners from 21 countries (or so) and waiting to fly out to Antarctica, the whole experience was so rich. When we finally landed in Antarctica, it was exhilarating. It was like being on another planet without leaving this one. The race itself went by in a flash even though it was a slow trek (two 13.1 mile loops, and 6.5 miles or so of each loop was in soft, ankle deep snow on a slight, straight upgrade on the glacier, making it like running in deep sand, with a headwind and white out conditions. The celebration that night was just an awesome experience with everyone feeling accomplished. Then we got stuck there for four days as the plane couldn’t land. It was amazing to spend time with people without internet or cell coverage because people actually had to communicate with each other!</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your upcoming races?</strong></em></p>
<p>I registered for the world marathon challenge in January 2017, then the North Pole Marathon in April 2017 to complete the 7 continents and grand slam.</p>

<p>Cody and Sabina are not your average bridesmaids, Kara Henry is not your average bride, and this is not your typical Bachelorette party. The plan is to run from Rim to Rim to Rim- 46 miles in one day. Their Newton Fates have months of training miles on them after a summer of pounding dirt. Their longest training run is 30 miles, leaving 18 miles of unchartered territory, and the potential for a lifetime of stories and memories. When asked what their back up plan is, Cody responded “Back up plan? Why would we need that?” Their strategy is to finish by any means necessary. For the remainder of September, we will be chronicling their journey to the Canyon, and the journey across it (and then across it again…and then again). Stay tuned!</p>

<p>In 1993, at the age of 13, Bo Parrish was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, and just 13 years later Bo nearly lost his life to it. His large intestine had ruptured and was leaking bacteria, his body was shutting down. A lifesaving surgery allowed him to survive and have a second chance at life and Bo chose to make the most of it as a triathlete, author and motivational speaker.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years Bo has transformed his mind, body and spirit to the strongest, most #Extraordinary state they’ve ever been. Currently, Bo competes as an elite amateur triathlete for Team Timex. He has taken his new outlook on life and transitioned his professional career from a financial advisor to a personal coach and author.</p>
<p>A good friend of Bo’s visited him in the hospital and planted the triathlon seed in his head.  The more Bo learned about the sport, the more fascinated he became. He wanted to take full advantage of this “new life” he was given, and that is exactly what he did. Bo took on his first triathlon in September of 2006, just months after being admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>Since his surgery, Bo has competed in over 150 athletic events around the world including seven full Ironman competitions and countless half Ironmans! “Not only did I embrace it, I went after it and I turned it into my motivation.” This second chance at life has not only given him the ability to achieve his athletic dream, but also his dream of writing his first book. “<u>The Problem with Perfect</u>” is an inspiring piece about discovering purpose. Bo’s mindset comes through strongly in the book, “Life is too short for perfect, but absolutely essential for purpose.”</p>
<p>Speaking of giving life purpose, when Bo isn’t writing, speaking or putting in 20+ hours of training a week, he stays active with the Nashville Striders and the Easy Nasty Running club participating in group runs and leading run form clinics. . He strives to teach men, women and children that there is a way to find the courage to pursue a passionate life!</p>
<p>Since his near death experience 10 years ago, Bo now embraces change rather than rejecting it. He sees it as a blessing, rather than a burden. His journey from being a hospital patient in the ICU to qualifying for the Ironman 70.3 World Championships is one that we would no doubt consider #Extraordinary.</p>
<p>With every keynote speech, Bo closes it with, “ You will never do anything differently in life until your pain of same becomes greater than your pain of change.”</p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Question: How did this not so average bachelorette party come about? </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Kara:</span></strong> This is 100% Cody’s idea. Don’t let her blame it on me. She came up with the idea and we all kind of ignored it at first…but she’s not someone who likes to be ignored. After hearing about it for a while, she told us one day that she found a great price on flights so we all caved and booked right then.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Cody:</span></strong> One morning a couple months back I nonchalantly said, “we should run the Grand Canyon.” Working at Newton, it’s easy to talk almost everyone into something crazy, so both Sabina and Kara were like “YES!” and then we booked a flight later that night.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Sabina:</span></strong> It was Cody’s idea… AND I am easily convinced when it comes to any adventure! We were all sitting at our desk one day and she came up with this crazy idea and within the next 10 minutes our tickets were booked! The best part about all of this is on our very first training run she looks back at us and says “I don’t really like trails or lots of climbing….”</p>
<p>*Apparently we remember past events a little differently….</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Question: Do you have any concerns about this trip?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Kara:</span></strong> Serious concerns? No. My concerns are more along the lines of: ‘will we be functional enough the next day for brunch and mimosas?’ and ‘how many times will Cody and Sabina use hashtag language instead of real words before I snap at them?’</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Cody:</span></strong> My main concern would be that I really prefer running on flat terrain, that is paved. Kara and Sabina have both told me that I need to get over that…quickly.</p>

				<p>The rains began the week of September 9 in Colorado, and they did not stop. By Wednesday evening, residents in the small town of Lyons, Colorado (with a population of just over 2,000) were being asked to evacuate their homes. Among those living in Lyons were triathlete, Chris Legh, with his wife and two daughters, who split their time between the small town and their native country, Australia. At this point, Legh was just one month out from competing in the 35<sup>th</sup> Annual Ironman World Championship—a race he has said will be his last as a career triathlete.</p>
<p>As the severity of the flood revealed itself, Legh’s first reaction was to forget about Kona and to just help out. But as the National Guard moved into help, residents were asked to leave. There wasn’t much they could do. In Boulder, the roads for riding and trails for running, were now damaged and closed, and many swimming facilities were shutdown. This was no longer an ideal place to train. Legh and his family went first to a friend’s place in Vail, Colorado, before deciding that their best move was to go straight to Kona. We caught up with him in between training in Kona.</p>
<p><b>Can you tell us about Lyons and the flood? </b></p>
<p>Our house was better off than most people. For us, it wasn’t a really bad situation, but we realized we were stuck in town and couldn’t get out. A lot of people in town were really messed up. Main Street survived quite well, but the two main businesses that were hit hard (The Fork and St. Vrain Market, Deli &amp; Bakery) are owned by two of our really good friends. We lived in Lyons for 8 years and we were there before the market and the Fork were upgraded. They are iconic places in town.</p>
<p>Everyone has to deal with mortgages and make sure their businesses survive. We just learned that the Montessori School our youngest daughter goes to will be shutdown for good. And our other daughter’s school has been temporarily moved to Longmont.</p>
<p><b>What were your thoughts on leaving? </b></p>
<p>I hated it. I knew people needed help. I almost lost my motivation to train because I wanted to help. But the only thing really that made it easier to leave was when I realized I couldn’t do a lot, we pretty much had to leave. It wasn’t possible to stay. But we all hated leaving our street and our town. I love the community.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"">What were your options?</b></p>
<p>Initially we went up to Vail. We had an option to stay up there and figure out what we were going to do. We were very lucky. Then we decided to head to Kona. I almost didn’t want to tell people I was going to Hawaii because it really doesn’t seem that important right now. But since I couldn’t help, I figured I might as well go do my little race.</p>
<p><b>Why is this race a big one for you? </b></p>
<p>It’s likely this is going to be my last race. I mean, it’s probably the last time I will call it my career in a sense, in terms of it being my occupation. I’ve been racing professionally for 22 years, I’ll always do something. I’ll never stop competing in something. But in terms of it being my occupation, this is going to be my last race.</p>
<p>Hawaii was the attraction for me to get into the sport. I had the itch to come back and race it one last time. Luckily, Melbourne Ironman went well for me. Then I did Coeur d’Alene, Calgary, Lake Stevens, I just had to chase points for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><b>Pulmonary edema has limited your racing, how are you feeling about it? </b></p>
<p>No one can give me an answer. I can be racing as hard as possible or by myself and it can happen. In the Melbourne Ironman earlier this year it didn’t happen. No one can give me an answer. It’s happened everywhere with no correlation to altitude. At Vail, I’m fine. It’s bizarre to know there’s a good chance you can’t reach your potential. I’ve raced long enough to accept it if it happens. Fingers crossed it doesn’t.</p>
<p><b>What are your expectations for Kona? </b></p>
<p>If I have the problems I’ve had in the past, it won’t be an ideal ending. If I’m racing well, I’ll have a smile on my face. Then I’ll walk away having enjoyed being here. I’m at a point in my career where I enjoy it and realize there is no real consequence in my performance. It’s a nice place to be. I’m sitting here now in Kona and I love it. I’ve been here and hated it.</p>
<p><b>So, if Kona is your last race, will you return to Lyons? </b></p>
<p>We were enjoying Colorado, but that’s the shame of it. We’re from Melbourne and Lyons was my one chance to live in a small town. We’ll go back to Lyons after the race, if we’re able to get back to Lyons. We’ll pack and fly home to Australia.  We’ll come back next year, sooner rather than later and finish off the school year.</p>
<p>But going back to Australia and the beach isn’t a bad option.</p>
<p><b>Do you have any words for Colorado right now? </b></p>
<p>I hope things improve. I know a lot of the family situations aren’t fantastic. I hope the businesses can survive and we can have our great little town back. More people need to ride out from Boulder when the roads are open to visit and support the town.</p>

				<p>With the 35<sup>th</sup> Annual Ironman World Championship just weeks away, we reached out to former 8x Ironman World Champion, Paula Newby-Fraser, to find out how the world of triathlon has evolved and to get her advice and predictions for this year.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Paula-Running.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4476"" alt=""O"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Paula-Running.jpg"" width=""470"" height=""540"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Paula-Running.jpg 470w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Paula-Running-261x300.jpg 261w"" sizes=""(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px""></a></p>
<p><b>How has triathlon changed from when you competed? </b></p>
<p>I’m not sure the formula is different, but it looks a lot different from when I competed simply because there are more athletes competing in triathlon and a lot more opportunities to race. It was very easy to narrow down the competition when I competed because there were only a handful of us.</p>
<p>When there were only a handful of triathlons, you simply went and did the big races. Now, the challenge is to pick and choose a few and focus on just doing well at those. But because there are so many races, there’s a lot more noise out there. I think it’s harder to say this is what I’m going to do and ignore the noise.</p>
<p><b>Did you have a formula you followed each year?</b></p>
<p>Yes. I would say okay I will do this, this, and this race, the rest will be local, shorter events and then I will go to Kona. And then the next year I would hit repeat. I would do shorter races, probably 2-3 longer international races and then go back to Kona. You can do that now, but there are distractions and opportunities and more athletes bidding for the top positions. There is a lot more talent in the field than in the late 80s and early 90s.</p>
<p><b>Has the landscape changed for training? </b></p>
<p>The landscape has changed significantly in terms of training. There seems to be more of a trend to do more training. Now, there are these communities, teams and clubs that get together and go into training camp a lot and in Boulder there is this hardcore group that just trains and trains and trains indefinitely for months on end. There are a lot of athletes who spend a lot of time training and I think one thing that goes on with camps and coaching and social media, and the evolution of everything around triathlon, is it sucks a lot of athletes into higher, faster, stronger, more, more, more. And the exposure to one another through clubs or social media keeps everyone pushing the envelope a little bit more and a little bit more.</p>
<p>Certainly in the late 80s and early 90s it was very insular, you could pick your path and it was easy to avoid getting pulled out of it. It was more rumor and story if you heard someone doing something. You couldn’t track someone on a training ride app where you can go and literally see what people are doing. Apps and social media can allow for a certain amount of overload and questioning. When you were insular, you decided what you were going to do and you got on and you did it. I didn’t spend a lot of time second-guessing what I was doing.</p>
<p><b>Do you have any predictions for this year? </b></p>
<p>It was interesting watching the 70.3 championships. The field was so big, but when all was said and done, it was the same people at the top. I don’t think you will see a significant change—history is always a good guide. Usually, there is one real breakthrough performance. Maybe there will be one or two new faces in the top 10, but the top contenders are consistent, and smart, and focused, that’s why they are at the top. This is barring any significant events—there are always a few injuries or unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p><b>What advice would you give these Ironman athletes?  </b></p>
<p>To me when people ask if I can give them my one piece of advice, I tell them it is all in how you handle the chaos of your mind. If you can direct that into the current moment of what you’re doing, it can definitely calm a lot of the chaos that goes on around competing in triathlon. There is a lot of the meditative process in training, but when it comes to competing people’s minds get a bit scrambled and chaotic. They forget that they have trained in the heat, or trained through good and bad situations. People get lost in races. So don’t get lost in the race, know that you have the capabilities to handle challenges the same way you have in practice. Everything becomes so magnified in competing, when it doesn’t need to be at all.</p>
<p><b>What’s it like for you to be a spectator at Kona? </b></p>
<p>I love to go to Kona. I love to watch it now. There’s a certain predictability, but always a certain excitement. It’s always my favorite race to watch. There is so much anticipation and somehow there is always a little bit of drama where you see such an acute level of excitement. It reflects the fact of what the sport has to offer, you’re watching the best athletes and physical talent and mental capacity. The women’s race last year was epic. It wasn’t a surprise to see the women fighting for it, they are the women who you expect to be up there, but the way it all unfolded was so interesting. It’s always by far my favorite race to watch.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"">Do you ever wish you were still out there competing?</b></p>
<p>I stopped wishing quite a number of years ago. I know what it took to be out there, year in and year out. I am inspired when I see athletes, but I don’t want to push myself that hard. I know how hard it is and I know how hard they’re pushing.</p>
<p>I don’t consider what I do training. I consider it more active lifestyle exercise. I work out every day, but there is nothing in particular that I do or that I’m training for. I always feel like I’m fit enough to jump into a half marathon or something like that. Being fit will always be a part of my life. But now, I’m just training for life.</p>
<p><b>When you look back, do you have a favorite race? </b></p>
<p>I don’t know that there was one, I was very blessed at having a number of races that were as flawless as you can get when I went to Kona. I look back and I am proud of my career. There were a lot more positive than there were negative, that’s a great batting average to have. And, I don’t say it was a sacrifice—that means you gave something up. I was doing what I wanted to do, it was my career and I loved it.</p>

				<p><strong>My Newtons and I Run Mongolia — Continent #5</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Getting There</b></p>
<p><b></b>In August, I spent a week in a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FCXuv6AiAc"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FCXuv6AiAc', 'Ger');"">Ger</a>—the Mongolian term for a Russian yurt—in remote northern Mongolia. Morning views were of the sunrise over Lake Hovsgol, the “Mother Lake”.  Reflections of the distant mountains were painted across the still water. The mornings were so quiet, that if one looked hard enough, they might envision <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan', 'Chinggis Khaan');"">Chinggis Khaan</a> and his men roaming the countryside on horseback. His legend lives across Mongolia. I knew the journey would be long, but the rewards of visiting a country with so much history would be worth the challenging travel.</p>
<p>The journey to Mongolia took two days. I left Portland, Oregon and made a quick stop in Seattle, before the long flight across the Pacific Ocean. Spending several hours on a layover in Seoul, Korea was a very surreal moment for me. At just 14 years old, I live away from home and my family. My days are spent training at the Utah Olympic Park in Park City, Utah, with aspirations of making the 2018 Winter Olympics in aerial skiing. It just so happens, that those Olympics will be held in South Korea. I walked through the airport that day knowing that I will hopefully return here in 2018, with my skis in tote, chasing my Olympic dream. Many people don’t realize, the many purposes my running serves. Running is great cross training for so many sports, especially skiing. I believe my cross training as a triathlete and runner give me an added advantage as a skier.</p>
<p>A three-hour trip from Seoul put us in the capital of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar. I would later learn to call it UB, as it is known amongst the locals. We spent one evening in UB, where I witnessed how underdeveloped the area was. Many of the main roads were dirt with patches of broken up concrete.  A layer of dust rose above the city and mixed with the pollution from the four coal power plants used to power the city. The total population of Mongolia is 2.8 million with more than 1 million alone living in UB. Childhood obesity is as much an epidemic here as it is in the U.S. The major contributing factor is felt to be the lack of vegetables and outdoor activities, which is compounded by the extreme cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Yet another early morning flight, one-hour north, put us close to the border of Russia. Russian minivans took us on a three-hour drive to Camp Toilogt. For the past 15 years, this camp, mostly visited by fishermen and avid horseback riders, has had about 70 runners converge on it from around the world to run the annual Mongolia Sunrise to Sunset 42 km and 100 km trail run in Hovsgol National Park.</p>
<p>I have been to remote areas in Kenya and Peru, but wasn’t quite prepared for what I would face in Mongolia. Most of us faced nutritional challenges the week leading into the race. We did not anticipate such a lack of fruit, vegetables, and the protein rich food that most athletes live on the days leading up to races. Refrigeration was limited, the dairy products were unpasteurized and rice was the main staple. The main water filter for the camp had broken so keeping up with fresh water meant boiling the water. Many of us tried to keep up on hydration by drinking the warm water or trying to cool it in our water bottles, which we submerged in the lake. Camp was at 5,000 feet, so runners needed to pay close attention to staying hydrated. I normally try to pack dried fruit, oatmeal, and bars, but was limited due to weight restrictions from the airlines. I definitely fell way short on my stash of pre-race food for this event. Luckily my stomach tolerated the change of nutrition fairly well, but others were less fortunate.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4413"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-1024x684.jpg"" alt=""Winter Mongolia"" width=""625"" height=""417"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-624x417.jpg 624w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p>Despite not having ideal conditions leading up to race day, everyone’s spirits remained high. Fourteen of the 70 race entrants were runners from all over the world who I had previously met at my second marathon in Kenya, the Amazing Maasai. We developed friendships and a running bond. We had decided to all meet up again in Mongolia, almost a year after the marathon in Kenya. We were also reunited with the Canadian filming crew, Boundless. They had filmed a segment with us in Kenya as part of their first season debut. Intrigued with my story in Kenya, the filming crew was kind enough to put together a great <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZpoWH1R9sQ"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZpoWH1R9sQ', 'video');"">video</a> about Team Winter. Having them join us in Mongolia and include us in their second season of filming was so much fun. The filming crew added a dynamic to camp and even caught my first “Hash Run” on film. (Hash Runs have now been modified so that non-drinkers and young people like me can participate as well.)</p>
<p><b>RACE DAY</b></p>
<p>Race morning was a 2 am wake up call. My mom had the usual morning fire already going. She would have a pot of hot water on the tiny stove that warmed our four-man Ger. The hot water would be used to make my pre-race oatmeal, which I had rationed specifically for race morning. Generators were used only two hours each evening to recharge phones and computers, but an exception was made race morning to provide early morning light. The weather was a runner’s dream, low 50s no wind and slightly overcast. The clouds would chase us up the mountain passes all morning, but never catch us.  About 70 runners, 33 for the 42 km and 35 for the 100 km lined up for the 4 am start. I was running the marathon, or 42 km.</p>
<p>By the pace of the first 100 yards of the race, you would think we were competing in an 800-meter sprint. The first 2.5 km’s of the course was very technical singletrack through the woods. The roots, low hanging trees, and stones made the trail—lit only be our headlamps—difficult for us to navigate in the darkness. Most of the top runners knew it would be difficult to pass during this section so there was definitely a race for positioning at the beginning. To my amazement, as I navigated the darkness with the lead pack, I would catch glimpses of the camera crew running the woods parallel to us trying to capture vital footage. The next 12 km were still in the dark along a rocky road next to Lake Hovsgol. The clouds hid the morning sunrise as we began our first ascent.</p>
<p>After a rewarding first climb we were greeted with a steep rocky descent with much loose stone, making for a difficult downhill run that didn’t allow for much recovery. There had already been many early morning falls by most of the runners, but luckily no serious injuries. By mostly pure luck, I managed to stay on my feet for the entire 26.2 miles.</p>
<p>The second climb humbled many of us, including myself. It was a steep climb through a mossy, dense forest that never seemed to end. I would occasionally find myself glancing around hoping to catch a glimpse of an area that might be the location of Chinggis Khaans’ burial site. To this day, no one has been able to identify the exact location of his tomb. At the summit of this second climb, stood an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovoo"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovoo', 'Ovoo');"">Ovoo</a>, a spiritual triangle of stones and flags that are found throughout the land and especially at the highest points of elevation. These are sacred areas thought to house the spirit of the dead. It is good luck to circle them clock-wise either once or three times and place offerings. Of course, I made my offering and circled three times before continuing on in the race.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4412"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-4-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""Winter Mongolia 4"" width=""625"" height=""416"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-4-624x416.jpg 624w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Winter-Mongolia-4.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p>Three aid stations filled with water, potatoes, tomatoes, and homemade donuts would be the only source of spectators on the course. An occasional sighting of the filming crew in the most obscure, remote locations would be the only other sign of life. There wasn’t a single time during the race that one couldn’t think about their foot placement due to the rocky nature of the course. The course proved a challenge to many runners. One person got lost for several hours and many of the 100 km runners quickly realized at the 42 km mark that the course would be too much to continue on. In the end, only about half of the 100 km runners that set out that morning actually complete the entire course. Many realized the 18-hour cut-off would be difficult to achieve and were happy to settle with 42 km. The last 42 km runner crossed the finish line in about 10 hours.</p>
<p>The course lived up to its name, “The Most Beautiful 100k” and definitely can be considered one of the more challenging races. I was pleased with my 5:55 finish and taking second place overall female. I have fallen in love with the challenges that trail running offers. I continue to learn much about running and most importantly about myself. Through my running, I’m not only able to raise awareness for prostate cancer, but to show that age and gender are not barriers! I am now just two continents away from setting a world record for the, “Youngest person to run a marathon on all seven continents”.  I will be headed to New Zealand in October followed by the completion of my <a href=""http://wintervinecki.com/world-marathon-tour/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://wintervinecki.com/world-marathon-tour/', 'World Marathon Tour');"">World Marathon Tour</a> in Athens, Greece in November.</p>
<p>As with every race, I learned afterwards of the unsung heroes that had run amongst us. Running in the <a href=""http://ms2s.dk/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://ms2s.dk/', 'Mongolian Sunrise to Sunset');"">Mongolian Sunrise to Sunset</a>, were some of the 1 in 6 men I run for.  After the race, they came to me and shared their stories of family members affected by the disease or their own personal story of battling prostate cancer. I learned that prostate cancer survivors had been out there running the 42 km and 100 km in silence, a silence broken only by the presence of a 14 year-old girl out there running with them and for them. May they “Never Give In!”</p>

				<p>I sat on the steep hillside with a 5-gallon bucket of gravel between my legs, protecting it from spilling. This was just a temporary stop to collect my strength as I climbed up the Killington, Vermont ski run. It was a brutal reminder that ski slopes are for skiing down and that is it! This same obstacle was my biggest challenge at my first Spartan Beast several months ago in Utah. The sight of a bucket now makes me cringe. Descending the hillside, with my bucket in my arms, I thought I might actually cry. As I dumped my gravel into the bin at the end, successfully completing the obstacle, I said to myself, “Pull yourself together, you still have a long way to go.”</p>

<p><b>Show Time</b></p>
<p>I had no idea this race would be so hard. Standing at the start line, I felt welcomed amongst my new Spartan family. I appreciated the cheers and well wishes from my fellow racers as my name was called to the start line of the Spartan World Championships. I found myself standing amongst some of the world’s greatest athletes. There were Olympians from around the globe as well as Xterra, USTAF and Trail World Champions, Professional Obstacle Course Racers, Adventure Racers, triathletes and marathon winners. This talented group of athletes, including the Spartan Pro Team, will be featured in the NBC Sports Network TV special about the World Championships on October 19th.</p>
<p>Given Spartan’s history and the presence of NBC TV, most of us assumed we were about to embark on the toughest, most grueling 13-mile course ever designed by Spartan. Little did we know how humbling the day would be—the steep climbs, cold water and grueling course would sideline even some of the world’s most fit athletes.</p>
<p><b>Climbing &amp; Descending</b></p>
<p>The first part of the course was mainly a steep never-ending trail climb up the hills of Killington Ski Resort. I was happy with my selection of running this course in <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running shoes</a>. (The Distance Elites to be exact.) I knew there would be a lot of serious climbing so I chose to stay on the lighter side with my shoes. I had done my last Spartan Beast in my Newton All-weathers. The unique lug design of Newton shoes is not only great for forefoot running but also provides great traction on these difficult courses. Spartans were once again falling, slipping and sliding on the steep descents and I was able to keep my footing. There were a few walls and round hay bails to climb on our way up, which is always fun.</p>

<p>Living and training at 7,000 feet in Park City, UT, as well as only carrying 98 pounds on my small frame, was a great advantage on the first part of the course. I was surprised to find myself hanging with many of the elite females for the first six to seven miles. It was only when we encountered the heavy obstacles, that their more adult bodies became a huge advantage for them.</p>
<p><b>Two-thirds My Weight</b></p>
<p>Upon reaching one of the few black diamond ski runs at Killington, I peered up the steep slope.  As far up the mountain as I could see, it was just a stream of racers carrying something. As I approached a pile of sandbags, I quickly realized there was only one size. Many of the weighted obstacles at Spartan Races have female and male sized weights. This was the World Championships, though, what was I thinking. There was no time to stop and think. This was a race!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4510"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry-1024x685.jpg"" alt=""Spartan Vermont Beast World Championships 2013-60#sandbag carry"" width=""625"" height=""418"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-60sandbag-carry-624x417.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p>As a competitive athlete, you learn to improvise as you go. I wasn’t sure how I would handle this heavy obstacle but knew I just had to get moving with it. I grabbed my sandbag, tossed it up onto my back and began the long trek. I would alternate carrying the weight on one shoulder, then the other. When both shoulders got fatigued, I would place it evenly across my upper back and neck.  The one thought I had the entire time was, “Why is a 14-year-old girl carrying what a grown man is carrying?” At the time, I had no idea I was carrying 60 pounds, literally two-thirds my body weight. All I knew was, “It was heavy”.  It was only after the race, that I had learned the actual weight we were all carrying.</p>
<p><b>Burpees &amp; Perseverence</b><b></b></p>
<p>The Hercules Hoist gave me my first set of burpees. A cement bucket is hooked to a pulley system.  You must use a rope to pull the bucket up to the top. As I started to hoist the bucket up, I would quickly find myself being pulled up in the air as the bucket returned to the ground. “You got to be kidding me! I’ve done this before. This cement bucket must be heavier than my last race.” After being lifted off the ground several times and only getting the weight half way up, I realized Hercules would win today. I immediately started doing my 30 burpees.</p>

<p>During the entire race I was reminded, “I had it easy.” I was not carrying a tumor, like my new friend, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auM8kK7qblg"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auM8kK7qblg', 'Iram Leon');"">Iram Leon</a>. He is 32 years old and living with an inoperable brain tumor, yet not letting it slow him down. I had two healthy legs unlike the amputee that crawled up the entire Killington ski slope on his hands and knees or like the female amputee who stood at the start line with me. I was able to just be at the event, unlike <a href=""http://teamwinter.org/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://teamwinter.org/', 'my dad');"">my dad</a> and many others that left this world too soon. It wasn’t hard to put my pain aside and persevere.</p>
<p>Having previewed the course the day before, I knew the water obstacles would come at miles seven and ten. Seeing all the water on this course, I also knew I wanted a shoe that had great drainage, not one that would hold water. I had poured water in my Newton trainers prior to the race to see how quickly it would drain out. Unlike many Spartans, I was not intimidated by the water, but rather excited. As a two-time triathlon <a href=""http://wintervinecki.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://wintervinecki.com/', 'national champion,');"">national champion,</a> I had been battling it out in the water since I was five years old. I didn’t take into account, however, how much wearing shoes affected your ability to swim. I was especially glad I didn’t wear a hydration pack like so many did. It would have been yet another thing to weigh me down as I swam across the frigid water and climbed up the rope climbs.</p>
<p><b>Tarzan &amp; The Tyrolean Traverse</b><b></b></p>
<p>The Tarzan Swing was nearly impossible! I heard of only one female who made it successfully across. This obstacle consisted of ladders and ropes suspended from a bridge in the middle of a lake. After swimming out and climbing up to the top of the bridge, there were about five or six little ropes. One had to swing across these ropes to get to the bell. I made it across two ropes then fell about ten feet into the lake.  As I swam to shore, my only thought was, “I think I’m turning into an ice cube.” As I crawled onto shore, it was burpee time again.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4503"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire-1024x685.jpg"" alt=""Spartan Vermont Beast World Championships 2013-barb wire"" width=""625"" height=""418"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartan-Vermont-Beast-World-Championships-2013-barb-wire-624x417.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p>Next up, the Tyrolean Traverse. Imagine a rope suspended across water; a kids dream, an adult’s nightmare! I may have moved slower than Sid, the two-toed sloth, but I made it! I hung below the rope with just my knees and elbows draped over the long rope that spanned the freezing cold, irrigation pond for the ski resort. There was no way I was going to fall off that rope, swim to shore, do 30 burpees and then have to reattempt it again. It was pretty intimidating seeing Elite men wrapped in a foil blanket at the edge of the water, hypothermic and unable to continue on. Today, the Tyrolean Rope would separate the winners from the losers. All I could think was, “Just hang on!” I have some great rope burns on my arms to show for my effort.</p>

<p><b>Pushing Beyond</b></p>
<p>The Spartan World Championships pushed me farther, mentally and physically, than I have ever been pushed before. However, with this being said, I know I have not reached my limit. There is always a take home lesson I learn from every race; whether it is a triathlon, a marathon, an aerial skiing competition or a Spartan Race. Spartan reminded me how crucial the mental component of a sport can be. Even if your body wants to give up, you can usually mentally keep pushing on and many times your body will recover. If you give up mentally though, it is over immediately.</p>

<p>For many, crossing the finish line on Saturday was the end of their race weekend. Placing first in the world in the 19 &amp; under open division and 28<sup>th</sup> amongst the elite females was perhaps my greatest accomplishment ever. However, the most important race to me was actually the next day. For the first time, Spartan offered a charity race. Beat up and exhausted but willing to do it all again, my team of five athletes, <a href=""http://teamwinter.org/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://teamwinter.org/', 'Team Winter');"">Team Winter</a>, set out Sunday morning to try to capture the Spartan Charity Race Title. Our team raced for the 1 in 6 men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer, the cancer that took my 40 year-old-dad from me when I was only 9-years-old.</p>
<p>We were expected to navigate a two- to three-mile course, with the fastest three times from each team counting. Seeing some of Spartan’s best obstacle course racers smiling at the start line Sunday and getting their “Spartan On” for something bigger than themselves was a great sight. These guys and gals went out with revenge and were ready to give everything they had left for their cause. Although Team Winter took 2<sup>nd</sup> place by only a few seconds, we were proud to stand on the podium as one of the top five teams in the world. Each team took prize money home for their charity and most importantly raised awareness for their cause.</p>

				<p>What is Plantar Fascia – by: Newton Running Athlete Dr. Mark Cucuzella</p>
<p>Plantar Fasciitis is the common term for what should be more accurately termed Plantar Fasciosis. <strong><em>itits</em></strong> is an acute inflammation caused by a trauma or infection. <strong><em>osis</em></strong> is chronic degenerative condition.</p>
<p>No evidence exists for an ideal treatment of this condition without identifying and treating the causes, which can be many. Since we have minimal quality literature to guide us, this advice comes from seeing hundreds of runners and guiding them in self corrections as well as an understanding of the basic anatomy and natural functioning of the foot.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Plantar Fascia?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The plantar fascia (PF) is a strong ligament that runs from the heel to the metatarsal heads in the front of your foot.</strong> This ligament helps absorb the shock that occurs when your foot contacts the ground. It has function in the windlass mechanism recreating the arch on takeoff.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/planter-fascia2.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-6269 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/planter-fascia2-300x300.jpg"" alt=""planter-fascia2"" width=""352"" height=""313""></a></p>
<p><strong>What is the Cause of Plantar Fasciosis?</strong></p>
<p>The PF is not designed to manage the majority of the load of running and walking. The intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the foot are designed to receive signals from the fascia and in turn manage the majority of the load. When those muscles are dysfunctional the load gets transferred to the PF which is unable to handle it likely leads to tears or <em>plantar fasciosis</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The may not just be Fascia. </strong>The pain often localizes to the inside front edge of the heel. There are muscles that share an insertion with the plantar fascia. The <strong>flexor digitorum brevis</strong> muscle runs directly above the plantar fascia. On the inside part of the heel the <strong>abductor hallucis</strong>, an important arch stabilizer muscle, attaches. (see image below)</p>
<p>The tendinous insertions of these muscles might play a role in this painful condition.</p>
<p>You can repair these tears by using passive methods such as rest and bracing but as soon as you hit the road or trail again you will likely suffer the same process. <strong>The only way that you can actually fix plantar fasciosis is to address the root cause. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Several Structural Causes can contribute to the Problem</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weak intrinsic muscles of the foot</li>
<li>A misaligned and weak first toe</li>
<li>Tight shortened calf muscles</li>
<li>Tight plantar fascia</li>
<li>Poor neuromuscular reflexive function of the foot- proprioception</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other Important Contributors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased mechanical stress from the amount of running or activity</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Adapting too fast from supportive footwear which inhibits intrinsic muscles to flat shoes or barefoot (i.e. summer if going quickly into flip flops or barefoot)</li>
<li>Poor walking and running mechanics</li>
<li><strong>Overly supportive footwear leading to instability.</strong> This is a paradox as shoes that over support will weaken the foot which in turn leads to the foot’s instability.</li>
</ul>

				<p>“You know how, as endurance athletes, we all tend to worry about not having enough iron?  We know the theory: iron is needed for energy – pass the juicy steak, raw spinach, and yummy kale please.  Let’s not forget that for an extra hit of iron we should add a generous dose of vitamin C, to boost the iron absorption.  Iron is a notoriously complex topic, with the primary role to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, maintain a healthy immune system, and for aiding energy production.  So, when we get fatigued from heavy training, which we invariably do, it is all too tempting to say, “I’m anemic, I need more iron!”.  Let me reach for that over-the-counter all solving iron supplement.  I scream, “Please don’t!”  I’ve found out the hard way that truth be told we can store <strong>too much</strong> iron in the body, and that can be toxic to the liver.  In my case I was blissfully unaware that I had way too much iron in my body.  The routine blood work for your annual physical exam does not usually include iron serum levels, or ferritin – a measure of the body’s ability to store iron.  Now, routine blood work for a physical <strong>does</strong> include Hemoglobin levels (iron is needed to make hemoglobin) and liver function tests.  These levels may be elevated if the body is storing too much iron.</p>
<p>Let me tell you my experience.  My Hemoglobin was high/normal, although my liver function AST (aspartate transaminase), and ALT (alanine transaminase) tests were high.  But if you are keen to get the full picture of your blood iron, ask for iron serum and ferritin analysis.  To be precise the technical term for iron overload is ‘hemochromatosis’.  The lucky ones will be asymptomatic, while others will have some, or all of, fatigue, joint pain, and darkening of the skin.  Now here’s the good news!  If you do happen to be the person who stores excess iron there is a simple fix.  Donate blood and for good measure drink black tea with your meals to help block that iron absorption.  You’ll be asking, “How often should I donate blood?” Once levels are under control it doesn’t need to be that often, maybe 3 times a year.</p>
<p>I found out that my iron level was high by having a few months of feeling awful, my body just felt ‘out-of-sorts’, and my feeling of fatigue was just unbearable.  Exhausted, unwilling to train, it was all I could do to get through the working day.  I felt like I was lost in a Bermuda Triangle of depression, anxiety and stress.  Depressed because I’d, kind of, lost my identity as an athlete, anxious about the future, and that I would be able to adequately care for my family.  Roadside naps are not really built into a workday.  Stressed because training is my stress relief and I could no longer do this.</p>
<p>I needed detailed blood work to find out what was going on. You’d think, with my complaints of fatigue it was suspected that my iron would be low.  Not off the charts high as it turned out to be. I was also carrying a very active form of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV).  The virus that causes Mononucleosis. Whether my fatigue was related to EBV AND the high blood iron is not clear. High iron can cause fatigue, but so does the EBV.</p>
<p>When my symptoms were at their worst I told Shawn (my husband), “I would rather have a broken leg than feel like this.  A broken leg you can see, and it has a finite time for bone healing. People look at me and can’t see there is anything wrong, people cannot understand how desperately tired I am!”</p>
<p>The athlete in me wanted to push through this.  I am used to performing while fatigued.  I’ve raced Ironman, and crushed Pikes Peak Marathon – one of the hardest marathons out there. But this is a different kind of fatigue.  Not tired legs fatigue, it is a brain-fogged fatigue. Every time I tried to exert myself (and by my own standards I was not exerting myself much, just some light exercise), I would crash a few hours later.  I felt the desperate need to pull over to the side of the road, and to take a nap.  All I could do, no matter how much I tried to override it in my mind, was to lie down.  I could not remember what it was like to not feel tired.  I became scared to do anything, as I didn’t want to bring on the fatigue and to be unable to function.  I must work and take care of my family, I felt like I had to really budget my energy resources.</p>
<p>Slowly with the help of dietary changes and supplements I am getting better, but it certainly hasn’t happened overnight.  My immune system function has improved and I have my blood-iron levels under control.  I had some good days, and gradually there were more good days than bad, and now only a bad day every now and again.  On the good days I had glimmers of my former self, able to sneak in a run albeit short and not feel like I was at ‘death’s door’, afterwards.  I ran barefoot at times to feel more connected to the earth and this seemed to help.  It reawakened that aspect of ‘play’ into my life, which as adults we should do more of.  I felt like my 5 years-old daughter dodging the cracks in the pavement, in my case, to avoid hurting my feet.  I became able to do some yoga, to breathe and to forgive my body for letting me down, and believe that maybe things were getting back towards ‘normal’ again.</p>
<p>I’ve changed my goal/performance focus for now, and decided how I want to project myself – minus the athlete part of me.  I am determined to model inspiration, hope, trust, and to function from a base of compassion and forgiveness.</p>
<p>I tell myself that I will emerge from this a stronger and better person for it all – but I’ll sure need a bit of hand-holding along the way!</p>
<p>We all fight our own battles; be it health battles, relationship battles, job battles.  You will probably have your own.  Life is fluid, and cyclical.  We are all in the same ocean; it’s just that some of us are riding different waves.  When you are on a high wave – cherish it.  When you are on a low wave – know that things WILL change.”</p>

				<p>Part 2 of What is Plantar Fasciitis by Newton Running athlete Dr. Mark Cucuzella</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do to Correct Plantar Fasciitis?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few basic principles but they will vary depending on the cause:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Any support from an orthotic, arch support, or taping in most cases should be a <em>temporary</em> modality while you strengthen and lengthen the tissues.</strong> Using one of these forever is akin to breaking your arm and leaving the cast on forever (in one week muscles begin to atrophy from disuse). If you have an uncorrectable structural problem a lightweight support might assist you.</li>
<li>Doing eccentric drop down and heel raise exercises from a stair can help. Place your foot on stair and drop your heels down and then go slowly up to the ball of foot.  It is OK to have a little pain doing this as long as it is getting progressively better.  This helps increase ankle dorsiflexion- a common culprit for PF.<a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/dorskiflexion.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-6284"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/dorskiflexion-200x300.jpg"" alt=""dorskiflexion"" width=""200"" height=""300""></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dorsiflex the big toe to lengthen PF if it is tight.</li>
<li>Get out of heels – gradually – in <em>ALL</em> activities. Do not wear shoes with heels that shorten your PF and place your foot in <em>all-day-dysfunction</em>: wear level footwear with a wide toebox.</li>
<li>Work on foot intrinsics. Pick things up with your foot. Walk barefoot.

<li>Strengthen your big toe by pushing it into the ground as often as you can whenever you are standing throughout the day. This will wake up the foot muscles and help recreate the arch.</li>

<p><strong>What About Orthotics?</strong></p>
<p>Custom orthotics and similar products attempt to stabilize the subtalar joint by supporting the arch, claiming to correct the poor biomechanics of the foot. This claim of correction is quite misleading. Orthotics can mask the symptoms by artificially supporting a dysfunctional structure along with its inherent muscle imbalances, while introducing a new angle of ground interface to the foot.</p>
<p>In most cases, the artificial support provided by orthotics has little or no effect on the alignment or structural integrity and your foot will become increasingly weaker and dependent on the support. These bracing and supporting characteristics may actually prevent proper alignment in the foot and ankle as they manage multi-directional activities, contributing to increased stresses at the ankle and knee. And the chance of injury increases when misalignment and increased stress combines with an unlocked structure.</p>
<p>From a biomechanical perspective, by introducing a new angle of ground interface, orthotics cause a shift in the dynamics of the repetitive movement. The symptoms resulting from the old dynamic disappear and the problem seems to be corrected. Unfortunately, over time or with increased activity levels at the new ground interface angle, the repetitive movement often results in new symptoms at different locations. This creates a recurring cycle where new orthotics are prescribed to compensate for the ever-migrating symptoms and pathologies. The current practice is to recommend new orthotics at least every couple of years.</p>

				<p>We got the below testimonial from Elizabeth in our inbox yesterday. I’ve never heard of the <a href=""http://www.nxtri.com/default.asp"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nxtri.com/default.asp', 'Norseman Xtreme Triathlon');"" target=""_blank"">Norseman Xtreme Triathlon</a> in Eidfjord, Norway, so I did a little homework. The term ‘extreme’ gets tossed about quite a bit these days, but after reading about the Norseman, I’m convinced it’s the real deal and I’m very impressed with Elizabeth’s performance. A few Norseman facts I learned:</p>
<p><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman2.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-146"" title=""norseman2"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman2-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman2.jpg 394w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px""></a>–The race begins at 5am with a 3.8K swim in the Hardangerfjord. Racers jump off the back of a boat for the for the water start.</p>
<p>–Next is a 180K bike leg, which includes a brutal 4,000 foot climb at the end.</p>
<p>–Finally, there’s a 42K run, which ends with a ridiculous 5K, 6,000 foot climb to the top of the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/nxtri/3017105898/in/set-72157608792372386/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/nxtri/3017105898/in/set-72157608792372386/', 'Gaustatoppen');"" target=""_blank"">Gaustatoppen</a>.</p>
<p>–After finishing at the top of the mountain, you have to walk back down, in the dark, after 140 miles and 20 hours of racing.</p>
<p>–Oh, and those Euros aren’t afraid to get <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/nxtri/3016327137/in/set-72157608792372386/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/nxtri/3016327137/in/set-72157608792372386/', 'buck naked');"" target=""_blank"">buck naked</a> at the race transitions.</p>
<p>Well, I think the Norseman certainly lives up to its billing as the world’s hardest triathlon and we’re duly impressed that Elizabeth was there, rocking her Newtons to a great finish!</p>
<p>Here’s her story:</p>
<p><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman3.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-147"" title=""norseman3"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman3-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225""></a><span style=""color: #000080;"">I just wanted to let someone know about my great experience in Newton trainers in the <a href=""http://www.nxtri.com/default.asp"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nxtri.com/default.asp', 'Norseman Xtreme Triathlon');"" target=""_blank"">Norseman Xtreme Triathlon</a> this summer. As a long-time runner and triathlon convert, I’ve been running in Newton trainers and racing shoes for just over a year. I love the way they feel, and have seen a huge improvement on hills, which have always been a weakness of mine. And within a week of using Newtons, they seem to have cured a long-time nagging injury in my left ankle.</span></p>
<p><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman4.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-148"" title=""norseman4"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman4-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""225"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman4-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/norseman4.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px""></a><span style=""color: #000080;"">But the true test of my Newtons was in the Norseman triathlon this summer. This iron-distance event finishes on the summit of a 6,000 foot peak.  The run climbs 10% grades on the road, then finishes with about 3.5 miles on a rocky trail to the summit. </span><span style=""color: #000080;"">My Newtons were amazing!  They made the transition from flat road to steep grade and even rocky trail perfectly, giving my feet plenty of support without weighing them down.  As one of the handful of women to finish on the summit that day, and the only one over 40, I attribute some of that success to the outstanding performance of my Newtons on race day, and the way they helped me train injury-free as I prepared for the race.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">Thank you for making such an outstanding product!  I look forward to trying the new all-weather version as I log a lot of miles in rough terrain and in the snow.</span></p>

<p>My friends and I took a few pics from the first annual Playa Del Rey Triathlon over the weekend and wanted to email ’em to ya – after posing we realized we were all wearing the same Newton Racers 😉  Anyway, I myself own 2 pairs of trainers and a pair of racers and did my first Ironman (France-Nice on June 27th) in the racers and they were AWESOME.  I’ve looked so long and hard for a pair of running shoes that work for me and let me just say that I will never wear any other brand of running shoes again!  No more back, hip, knee or plantar pain since wearing Newtons!  Zero!  My brother lives near your original store in Boulder so I’ll definitely stop in next time I’m in town.  Thanks for making such an awesome product!</p>

				<p>There’s been a rumor floating around that Craig Alexander, aka Crowie, shaves the lugs off his Newton shoes. Now, we do know that Crowie did shave his head, his face, his legs, and most importantly, a bunch of time off his run in Kona, but NOT his shoes. To quell the rumor mill once and for all, here’s Crowie’s response in his own words:</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">“For a while now I have been aware of a rumor circulating that I in some way alter my Newton Running Shoes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;""><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/crowie_shoes2.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-122"" title=""crowie_shoes2"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/crowie_shoes2-199x300.jpg"" alt=""Crowie\'s \"" width=""199"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/crowie_shoes2-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/crowie_shoes2.jpg 680w"" sizes=""(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px""></a>To be brutally honest, this is insulting to me on every level. What is being suggested is that I would promote a product to my fellow athletes and then not actually use it myself. I feel this is a massive attack on my integrity. The truth of the matter is, I ran in Newton running shoes by choice for three months before I signed on as a sponsored athlete with the company.</span></p>
<p>And in fact, when I placed second on debut in Kona last year, I was not under contract to Newton Running. I have not trained or raced in anything else since the end of July last year.</p>
<p>The great thing about being a consumer is you get to try products and choose what you like. So anyone considering buying running shoes, I urge you to do exactly what I did, and that is to try everything that is available and then choose the best.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">If you look at the post- race photos of me at the finish line last Saturday <span style=""color: #000000;"">(click photo above to enlarge)</span>, you will notice that my shoes are in no way altered from their intended state. Also, the photos of my little post-race celebration, which I heard has also been misinterpreted, will show on close inspection that nothing has been done to the shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;""><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/crowie_shoes3.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-123"" title=""crowie_shoes3"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/crowie_shoes3-300x231.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""231"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/crowie_shoes3-300x231.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/crowie_shoes3.jpg 401w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px""></a></span><span style=""color: #000080;"">Just to clarify, I took my shoes off at the finish line to beat out the flames because they were ” smokin’ hot” after having just run a 2:45 marathon.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">If in the future, anyone out there feels the need to make an ill-informed opinion about any of my sponsorships, please feel free to contact me before you make a total and utter fool out of yourself. All you are actually doing is bringing myself and a great product and company into disrepute. Have some backbone and question my integrity in person rather than through an anonymous chat site.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">The people starting these rumors need to pull their heads in.  You are out there intentionally spreading lies and mis-truths. I’m not sure what your agenda is, but you should  have a good look at your own motives and integrity.”<br>
</span><span style=""color: #000080;""><br>

It took me about a month to transition to my new Newton shoes. Since then, my racing delta has changed from about 7:45 to 7:10 minute miles, with less expenditure of energy. These shoes have totally changed my running enjoyment. I think you need a training CD with each shoe sale (<em>ed. note, check out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/NewtonRunning"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/user/NewtonRunning', 'our videos on YouTube');"" target=""_blank"">our videos on YouTube</a>, with more on the way</em>). I just happened to see a triathlon video on forefoot landing, just before getting your shoes. I would never had made the transition without the video. I believe my best races are ahead of me! My regular running buddies are a little grumpy with me. This has been the easiest way to gauge my running improvement; I’m now running with the next fastest group!<br>

<p>Tim also wrote a terrific race report. Read more below:</p>
<p><span id=""more-174""></span></p>
<p>I WON IRONMAN WESTERN AUSTRALIA!!!</p>
<p>Now if you care to keep reading, this is how my race preparation went.  I raced my last race in Port Macquarie at the Scody Half Ironman on November 9th, and I didn’t come good until the Thursday after that race.  This left me less than three weeks to squeeze in some hard sessions, and to also have a few days of tapering before my travel out to Busselton.  I had not done any specific full Ironman training prior to my last Half in November, so I really needed to make these two and a half weeks some quality training efforts.  My coach, Grant Giles hooked me up, and I was really happy with the preparation.</p>
<p>I was excited to have Mum and Mick (Stepdad) there, as well as my girlfriend, Emily, and my Manager Mike.  Bernard, who is the Managing Director of my clothing sponsor, Scody, happened to be in Perth for a cycling event, and came down to watch, and it was awesome to have him there for my first major win.  Also I knew I was going to have my mate, and legendary race announcer, Pete Murray on the mic, and he always gives me great motivation before, and during the events.</p>
<p>We all travelled out on Thursday, and it took the better part of a day to make it from Port Macquarie to Bussleton, Western Australia.  I did some light training Friday and Saturday, and then the rest of the time was consumed with bike check-in, pre-race briefing, etc….</p>
<p>Race morning was cool, and I was relaxed and optimistic about getting a podium spot.  Unfortunately, reigning IMWA Champion, Patrick Vernay, succumbed to an intestinal bug, and was a late scratch from the event.  This gave me some more confidence, but the were still five other guys with Ironman titles to their name, as well as several others that have podiumed in some major Ironman’s.</p>
<p>I knew Luke McKenzie was going to nail the swim, and I figured he might drag some others with him, but I didn’t want to expend too much energy chasing Luke, because I knew there were going to be some fast riding with the likes of Oscar Galindez, Leon Griffin, Jason Shortis, Brian Fuller, and Jimmy Johnson, so I just wanted to be out with that crowd, or possibly just ahead of them out of the swim.  And that is how the swim unfolded.  Luke McKenzie had Luke Bell with him and we came out about 1:40 behind them.  They opened up their lead while we were heading out around the first lap, then McKenzie dropped his chain, and ended up being swallowed up with the group I was riding with, and Bell was out on his own.</p>
<p>We were hammering through the course and I found my energy level fluctuating, but nothing major.  We were taking turns at holding a good pace, and at times it felt quite easy, but I ended up riding the 180 Km, in 4:26:43 which is a personal best.  At the start of our final lap on the course, we caught Bell, and then Jimmy Johnson took off, and nobody chased.  We saw him at some of the turns and I heard his lead got up to about 4 minutes.  However, that was all in vein, because we were only about 20 seconds behind him when he finished the bike leg.</p>
<p>The pack entered into the bike compound, when we could watch Jimmy entering the change tent.  I made a quick transition, and ended up going out on the run in first place.  I gave it a big kick, and began to drop Jimmy and the others within the first kilometer.  I was feeling great, and my stride and form felt strong, so I kept this pace for a while, but then saw I was running a 3:20 kilometer, so I decided to slow it down a little because I was concerned over blowing up, later in the race.  I continued to open my gap on second place, but then around the 23 Kilometer mark, I started to hit a bad patch.  I tried to keep my form, and I continued to struggle until the 28 Kilometer mark.</p>
<p>I could hear reports that Jason Shortis was closing in on me, which surprised me, because last time I saw him, he was back a fair way.  Well, he caught me at the 30 Km mark and after a short time of running off my shoulder, he gave it a kick, and made 20-30 meters on me.  I was feeling wasted, and we came up on the aid station.  I grabbed a PowerBar Gel, and a cup of coke, and got it into me while Jason was holding a 30 meter lead over me.  After getting the sugar into me, I got myself back up along side Jason, and we ran together for awhile shoulder-to-shoulder.  It was an incredible feeling to be part of this dual with a legend and the crowds were going wild along the course.  I decided to give a big surge and see if I could break him, so I gave it a big kick, and quickly put 20 metres on him.  I then relaxed my pace, but held my form.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the southern turnaround, and headed back on my final leg, I could see the gap had extended to about 400 metres, and I knew then the race was in my reach.  As I headed back north, the crowds were great, and when I was about two kilometers from the finish I began to get into it.  The helicopter was hovering low over the beach and I gave the cameraman a little wave and a smile.  I couldn’t believe this was all happening, and I was soaking it up.  I could hear Pete getting the crowds worked up, when I was about a kilometer away, and by the time I was running down the chute, I had every emotion going through me.  I am still pinching myself to make sure this is real, but with all the recognition I got in town today I’m getting the feeling this isn’t a dream.</p>
<p>I was happy with every leg of the race.  I swam the 3.8 Km in 0:50:25, then rode the 180 Km in 4:26:43 (PB), and then ran the 42.2 Km Marathon in 2:49:56 (fastest run of the day).</p>
<p>I want to thank all of you that have believed in me over the years, and given me support.  I want to share this win with all of you.  Thanks.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

</p><p>Meanwhile, the March issue of Running Times features a in-depth article on midfoot running by Brian Metzler. In the story, Metzler includes quotes from the major proponents of midfoot running, including Danny Dreyer, Malcolm Balk, Nicholas Romanov and Newton Running’s cofounder, Danny Abshire. The article delves into the history of running technique and includes results from some interesting midfoot running studies. It’s a much more detailed and in our opinion, more valuable story for readers than the very cursory midfoot shoe review in Runner’s World.</p>
<p>At Newton Running, our first priority is helping runners to learn faster, more efficient running technique. Metzler’s article in Running Times presents one of the more comprehensive and compelling arguments for runners to try midfoot running that we’ve seen to date.</p>

Over ten years ago, when <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running </a>co-founder Danny Abshire first started testing radically different running shoe prototypes, he recognized  the importance of a quantitative, scientific results to prove Newton technology designs worked.</p>
<p>However, Danny soon learned that current lab testing is  antiquated and frustrating ‘science’ at best. For years now, the standardized running shoe lab test has consisted of a piston that hammers down on the heel of a shoe to test cushioning. There are numerous problems with this testing method, but first and most obviously, it only evaluates the heel – not very useful for Newton shoes, which focus technology in the forefoot of the shoe.</p>
<p>Enter: MIT graduate students.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">For their 200 level engineering class, a team of MIT engineering students spent the last semester developing a new running shoe lab test. Here’s the abstract from their presentation:</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">“Current ASTM tests on running shoes are insufficient because they do not reliably capture the loads and displacements applied to shoes during running. This team will discuss a 3-axis machine that can be used to test running shoes that mimic’s natural running more accurately than conventional tests.</span></p>
<p>The design is comprised of a phantom foot that replicates the passive properties of a human foot and an actuated base that can impose the relevant kinematics to the running shoe. The shoe is mounted on motor to give a rotational degree of freedom. The shoe and the base are instrumented to measure force and displacement dynamically during the running cycle.</p>
<p>The machine can be calibrated to emulate different types of runners by adjusting the trajectories of the base. As a proof of concept we have collected force, displacement and energy data from the machine.”</p>

<p><em>By Danny Abshire, co-founder, Newton Running</em></p>
<p>When most people take up running for general fitness or to train for a marathon, they don’t think twice about how to do it. They buy a pair of running shoes, lace ‘em up and start running.</p>
<p>While that simplicity is one of the things that makes running so desirable, if you start running without learning proper form, you could wind up being woefully inefficient, and, worse yet, set yourself up for a <a title=""Preventing Injuries"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/newton-running-videos/injury-prevention/177-prevent-running-injuries"" target=""_blank"">variety of debilitating injuries.</a></p>
<p><strong>What is Good Form?</strong></p>
<p>To run efficiently, you have to understand your body and how it naturally moves across a surface with as little muscular force as possible. Along those lines, the tenants of good running form include running with short strides and a quick cadence, landing lightly on the midfoot/forefoot area (the ball of the foot, but not the toes), and quickly lifting your foot off the ground instead of pushing off with excessive muscle force.</p>
<p>A slight forward lean and a relaxed arm swing are also key components. To view an example of good running form in action click on the “Run Right” video <a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/newton-running-videos/run-right-video"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Land/Lever/Lift</strong></p>
<p>To illustrate what Newton Running calls the “<a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/land-lever-lift"" target=""_blank"">Land-Lever-Lift</a>” technique, take the simple test of running barefoot across a smooth floor. More than likely, you’re naturally going to land lightly at your midfoot/forefoot and quickly pick up your foot to start a new stride. Your body doesn’t allow you to land on your heels because it isn’t engineered to accommodate the blunt force trauma of repeated heel striking.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest mistakes distance runners can fall prey to are:</p>
<p>1) Excessive heel striking that causes abrupt braking of forward momentum, and then pushing off too hard with the toes to start the forward motion again; or</p>
<p>2) Using only propulsive muscles,(the calf group, hamstrings and Achilles tendon) by running too far up on their toes like a sprinter and not using the body’s natural cushioning system.</p>
<p>Each of those form flaws puts too much vertical movement into every stride, and that leads to inefficiency and considerably more impact, muscle and tendon stress on the body.</p>
<p>If you’re landing hard on your heels and excessively braking and then pushing off, you’re going to strain the muscles used for braking (especially the quadriceps group and the anterior tibialis along the front of your lower leg) and propulsion (calf and hamstring muscles), as well as the connective tissue in the lower leg, ankle and foot (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fascia"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fascia', 'plantar fascia');"" target=""_blank"">plantar fascia</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon', 'Achilles tendon');"" target=""_blank"">Achilles tendon</a>), and that can lead to a variety of injuries.</p>
<p>And if you’re too far forward in a sprint position, you’re overusing your calf and hamstring muscles and putting a lot of strain on your Achilles tendon.</p>
<p><strong>Good Form Matters</strong></p>
<p>You wouldn’t enter into any other sport without learning proper form, so why do it in running? For example, if you bought a brand new pair of golf clubs and went out and hit 100 balls at the driving range without any instruction or idea about proper swing technique, you’d probably have inconsistent form and very mixed results, plus you’d wind up tired and very sore the next day.</p>
<p>Good form because it leads to efficiency, which equals less impact and that equals injury prevention. The key is running relaxed and having the awareness to just touch the ground and lift quickly on every stride.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">“First of all, let’s set the record straight. Man is a natural long distance runner. Despite impressions to the contrary foisted on us daily from our predominantly sedentary and ‘well-fed’ modern lifestyle, it is interesting to note that for long enough distances a well-trained human can outrun just about any other creature on the planet.” </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Weiner then further evaluates:</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">“In fact, consider the following: Man evolved to run barefoot, and shoes arrived on the scene only in the last few tens of thousands of years or so. Try running barefoot some time (preferably on a softer surface like grass) and pay attention to your foot strikes. You might find that it’s almost impossible to land heel first. Your command central (your brain) just won’t let you do it. Too much jarring. Your bare heel isn’t designed to handle that pounding. The evidence supports that landing nearer the middle to front of the foot is the most efficient way to go.”</span></p>

<p>We’re incredibly proud of Newton’s co-founder and CEO, Jerry Lee, who was inducted into the Boulder County Business Hall of Fame yesterday. Over 400 people attended the event, which inducted seven new members who, “who exemplify business, cultural and philanthropic achievements that serve as the foundation of communities in the county.”</p>
<p>From the Boulder County Business Report.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Jerry Lee</span></p>
<p>For real estate developer/entrepreneur Jerry Lee, the first important fork in his road of life came when he chose take a job with W.W. Reynolds and move to Boulder from Illinois, leaving behind not only his parents, but 14 brothers and sisters as well.</p>
<p>“Our family is very close, so it was difficult,” he said.</p>
<p>Working as an accountant for the company, Lee took lessons in real estate development from his boss and mentor, William Reynolds, and was named company president in 1983. As a continuation of his partnership in real estate development with Reynolds, Lee created his own company, Lee Real Estate, in 2000.</p>
<p>In recent years, Lee took another road by assisting local entrepreneur Danny Abshire in designing and marketing a new athletic shoe. First marketed in 2007, the Newton is an ergonomic, lightweight running show that mimics barefoot running while providing greater cushioning on impact. The Newton is a culmination of Lee’s passion for running, which has led him to compete in 15 marathons.</p>
<p>Lee’s philanthropic work includes serving on numerous committees for the city of Boulder, including serving more than a decade on the Boulder Urban Renewal Board.</p>
<p>Today, Lee runs Lee Real Estate and serves as chief executive of Newton Running Company. He also continues to partner in real estate projects with Reynolds.</p>
<p>Lee lives in Boulder with his wife, Donna. The couple has two children.</p>
<p>“I believe in the old adage of treating people the way you want to be treated. It’s super important and has been a key to my career,” Lee said. “And in order to be successful, sometimes you have to find out the hard way that there are things you think you know – but you really don’t.”</p>

<p><small>By <a title=""Danny Abshire"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/community/newton-team/29-team/107-danny-abshire"">Danny Abshire</a>, co-founder, Newton Running</small></p>
<p>I’ve been coaching efficient running and injury prevention through optimal running form, foot support and footwear for years. It would be naïve to go by the results of sponsored elite athletes and satisfied customers, but the initial results of a study started last spring at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reinforced my ideas.</p>
<p>The study, conducted through the Chemistry of Sport class taught by Dr. Patti Christie, took 25 athletic individuals with various running abilities and put them through an eight-week distance running program. The research was based around running 4x800m or 4x1600m repeats while holding a constant heart rate.</p>
<p>The first set of intervals was done in traditional EVA foam-midsole running shoes the participants started the program with, while the latter was done in Newton Running Trainers (Gravity and Motion). That preliminary data revealed that all of the runners who completed every workout recorded faster times in the final interval wearing Newton shoes. Results showed that 77 percent of the runners ran faster on two or more intervals wearing Newtons and 55 percent of the runners were faster on every interval.</p>
<p>“The results were statistically significant,” says Christie, who is continuing the study with a new group of runners this spring. “It indicates there is a more efficient way to run. And if you combine the Newton Running technique, <a title=""Good Running Technique"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/land-lever-lift"">‘Land-Lever-Lift’</a> with the Newton shoes, there was definitely a significant difference.”</p>
<p>If you were to run barefoot along a smooth sidewalk, your body wouldn’t have you impact on your heels because it isn’t engineered to accommodate the blunt force trauma of repeated heel striking. Through increased forefoot communication with the ground Newton shoes allow for the body’s natural propensity for a light forefoot landing, foot leverage and a lifting of each new stride (instead of pushing off) known as the <a title=""Good Running Technique"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/land-lever-lift"">“Land-Lever-Lift”</a> technique.</p>
<p>Newton Running’s patented <a title=""Action/Reaction Technology"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/science/action-reaction-technology"">Action/Reaction</a> forefoot technology encourages Natural or Barefoot Running Gait and enhances the shock absorbency, leverage and energy return in the forefoot. Newton’s Independent lab research shows the system returns up to 28 percent more energy and reduces impact up to 44 percent when compared training and racing shoes offered by leading running brands.</p>
<p>The basis of natural form and midfoot/forefoot running gaits has been around for decades, much of it derived from the super-efficient form elite runners have been employing for years.</p>
<p>“It’s not new, it’s just that most runners have either gone away from what they used to do or they were never taught the proper way to run in the first place,” says Malcolm Balk, a Montreal-based running coach, form guru and competitive masters runner who teaches The Art of Running workshops in Canada and the United Kingdom. “I think the most important thing is that you need to keep braking to a minimum if you want to reduce muscular effort and the impact that goes with it.”</p>

<p>The background and science referenced in the article support the entire premise upon which Newton Running is based. Namely, humans evolved to run on their forefeet, not their heels. But, the running shoe industry has been building shoes with exaggerated heel cushioning for over twenty years and thus millions of runners have learned to be heel-strikers.</p>
<p>Newton Running believes that forefoot/midfoot running is the most natural, efficient running form and our shoe technology is based upon that philosophy.</p>
<p>Check out this quote from the Popular Mechanics story:</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">“Sean Murphy, manager of advanced product engineering at New Balance, says shoe companies often fall back on what he calls the 22-12 solution-placing 22 millimeters of material under the heel of the shoe and 12 millimeters under the forefoot. “Shoe companies have been stuck in the paradigm of the 22-12 for years,” Murphy says, and people buy them in part because it’s the feel they’ve grown accustomed to. “We’re just now building products for people who tend to run more on their forefoot, like many ultramarathoners.”</span></p>
<p>Newton Running shoes measure 22 – 18 mm for the Racers, 23 – 18 mm for the Trainers.</p>
<p><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe-testing-470-858-0409.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-495 alignleft"" title=""shoe-testing-470-858-0409"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe-testing-470-858-0409.jpg"" alt=""shoe-testing-470-858-0409"" width=""338"" height=""226""></a>All the major shoe companies are still testing the heel cushioning on their shoes. Newton, on the other hand, has been rigorously testing forefoot impact on its shoes, compared to other top selling brands. Check out these results provided by Knight Mechanical Testing.

Breathe.</span> </span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Karla, serif;"">A conventional wisdom piece of advice. But here’s how to breathe. Put one hand over your belly button. Breathe slowly in for a count of 5, then slowly out for a count of 5. Pay attention to your hand. Work to breathe deeply so your hand is moving up and down with each breath. Take at least 3 cycles of breathing in this 5-5 manner.</span></span></p>

Connect to your surroundings.</span> </span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Karla, serif;"">Continue to breathe slowly, deeply, and mindfully. Reconnecting to your senses is going to help you reduce negative cognitive rumination and help you stay grounded in the present moment. Start by noticing 3 things you can see, looking for small details. Describe in your mind what it is you see, looking for small details in your surroundings, those around you etc. Then notice 3 things you hear. Again, describe in your mind what you hear, looking for small details in your environment. Try to stay focused on the physical properties of what you hear, rather than what people are saying.</span></span></p>

Connect to gratitude.</span> </span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Karla, serif;"">Connecting to gratitude helps you refocus your energy onto the positive aspects of your race and all it took to get you to the starting line in the first place. Consciously remind yourself of 3 things you are grateful for in that moment. “I am grateful for having the physical ability to be here today. I am grateful for having the opportunity to test my limits. I am grateful for my health.” Be as clear, crisp and genuine as you can.</span></span></p>

Connect to the community.</span> </span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Karla, serif;"">One of the greatest aspects of running is the connection to a larger community all passionately pursuing goals. Waiting in the starting corral or walking around the pre-race expo are both great reminders of this connection. Be present with those around you, appreciating the presence of the others lining up. Be reminded of all the people who made it present for you to be at the starting line today. Be thankful for your coach, your team, your family, your support system. Picture those individuals in your mind and give them a quick internal recognition of thanks.</span></span></p>

Re-frame anxiety.</span> </span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Karla, serif;"">Many runners try to not be anxious. This is going to backfire each and every time. Pre-race excitement is necessary for optimal performance. Cognitively appraise the internal sensations in a positive way is important – rather than saying or thinking you’re anxious, remind yourself that this level of excitement sets the stage for your body to perform optimally. Positive self-talk about what you’re feeling with statements of, “This means I’m ready and prepared for the task at hand,” “I’m excited about being able to run well today,” “This is not anxiety, this is excitement, which means I’m going to perform at my best” are going to help you settle down and focus. It also helps you be in charge of your thoughts, rather than the thoughts being in charge of you.</span></span></p>

Be crisp about these thoughts, making them “I am” intentions as clear as you can make them: “I am going to manage my pace,” “I am going to run _____ splits for the first ___ miles,” “I am going to ensure that I control what I can and let go of the rest.” These are just ideas. Make them specific and genuine to you. These statements help you dial in your focus for your race day strategy.</span></span></p>

Now, intentionally take 3 slower, deeper breaths, as big as you can make them. You’re ready!</span></span></p>

				<p><strong>Giving women a voice and a future, Newton Running and Trickle Up collaborate to create a new path for Guatemalan women<br>
</strong><br>
<strong>BOULDER, Colorado</strong> — <strong>August 16, 2017</strong> – In Guatemala, 9 million people live in extreme poverty on less than $1.90 a day. Newton Running and Trickle Up continue to tackle this extreme poverty by working to transform the lives of women in Guatemala. With the support of Newton Running and Trickle Up, women will build small businesses and social connections so they can better feed their families, save for the future, and find a voice in their households and communities. With the expertise of Trickle Up, an organization committed to empowering the world’s poorest people, Newton Running sponsored a group of women in Tamahu, Guatemala to help them overcome extreme poverty. During an 18 month collaboration, Newton Running and Trickle Up will be following three individuals on their journey out of extreme poverty as part of the Rio Jolomche savings group. Together, Newton Running and Trickle Up will feature the stories of Carmelina, Aurora, and Petronila in Jolomche, a small enclave in Tamahú, Guatemala. Visit the <a href=""http://www.trickleup.org/newton"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.trickleup.org/newton', 'Trickle Up website');"">Trickle Up website</a> to learn more about the campaign. The site will feature updates on the women’s’ triumphs and challenges as they confront extreme poverty. Newton Running will be sharing the progress of this effort, and asking customers to share what motivates them with the hashtag #runwithpurpose. Below is the second update from Guatemala:</p>
<p><strong>Rio Jolomche Savings Group</strong><br>
Just five months after forming, the Rio Jolomche Savings Group has saved $822.50 collectively, and they are loaning to each other to buy food for their families and invest in their businesses. Group trainings have helped strengthen the women’s solidarity. For example, when they began planning their businesses, according to one participant, “we were inspired by what others were doing, which strengthened our ideas.”</p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong><br>
Aurora Beb Caal used her seed capital to buy thread to weave güipiles (traditional Mayan blouses) with the help of her two daughters. “I am changing my attitude, teaching new things to my children, and doing things I didn’t do before. My daughters have learned to knit. I also explained to my husband about the savings group. I look forward to the end of the cycle when I receive more than I saved,” she tells us.</p>
<p><strong>Carmelina</strong><br>
Carmelina Xol Toc and her family started several businesses: vegetable growing, shoe repair, and chicken farming. Her son Edgar, who lives with epilepsy, runs the shoe repair and accompanied his mother at the first meeting of the savings group. The family already notices a difference in their lives; now they can occupy their time building diversified livelihoods. “We can use the profits to buy family members things they like and medicine,” Carmelina says.</p>
<p><strong>Petronila</strong><br>
After doing a market assessment, Petronila Och Tipol decided to invest her seed capital in a store selling daily necessities. To diversify her income, she also bought chickens to raise and sell, and her daughter is weaving. With her profits, she hopes to afford food year round and fix her house. They have already invested in reinforcing the back wall, and now “no more water enters the house.”<br>

				<p>“One day I woke up and realized I was not living the kind of life I wanted to be living. My life was incomplete. Passionless. Despite being married (at the time) and having two children I knew I needed to make a change. However, taking the steps to make that change would be painful. I no longer wanted to play with society and go along for the ride. I needed more. I just did not know what it was.  It was scary and made me sad. ”</p>
<p>As I was going through the motions to take control of my life I had a friend suggest that I compete in a triathlon. I did not even know what it was, but reluctantly I agreed. In college I was a swimmer and vowed never to get into a pool again after my last swim meet. I had no bike, nor had I ridden a bike since I outgrew my baby blue Huffy when I was 11, but I did dabble in running races.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/ginny1.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-6326 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/ginny1-300x298.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""298"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/ginny1-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/ginny1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/ginny1.jpg 750w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px""></a></p>
<p>Flash forward to August, with 2 months of “training” under me, I went to my race.  It was an Olympic Plus distance. I was nervous, but also excited. In transition figuring out set-up, what sticker went where, and how to rack my bike had me feeling slightly overwhelmed.  Everyone else looked so confident and moved with purpose.  As I pulled my wetsuit on (for the first time) and walked down to the water a calm washed over me.  I could do this.  I entered the water and moved to the front.  I had no idea what would happen, but I was at home in the water.  The horn sounded and I went. Coming out of the water I had a smile ripped from ear to ear as I ran to my bike. I put on my shoes and mounted at the line.  I had learned to love the bike and felt confident.  Coming back into transition I was not aware of anyone else around me. I was in a zone and loving the day. I quickly changed into my running shoes and hit the pavement.  The strides came easily and my heart was pumping.  I heard the sound of my breathing in my ears and was pushing myself to go harder and faster.  It hurt so badly, but I loved it.  As I neared the finish line I heard somebody yelling, “Here she comes! The first female!” I did not really understand what that meant until I heard the announcer saying, “Congratulations Ginny Cataldi! Our first female finisher from Phoenxiville PA. With a time of….. ”  I was flying high, but not because I had won my first race. It was because I had accomplished something that made me feel alive and free. I had pushed myself to a place I never thought capable.  My passion was born.  I was happy, hungry and I wanted more.  Finally, I saw a glimpse who I wanted to become.</p>

<p>As I look back on how it all started (the 12 x’s 70.3 [most recently just placed 5th in my AG at Worlds] the 4x’s 140.6 [one of which was Kona and number 5, which is quickly approaching, will also being Kona]) I vow never to forget my roots.  I did not understand what living a life of fulfillment meant and I found myself through this sport.  When I set out to race an Ironman in 2014 my goal was to inspire people.  I set up an IG page and started making connections.  Everyone has a story.  Everyone has something they battle.  My goals were to give hope, advice and motivation.  Everyone deserves to be happy no matter how that looks.  I met this sport and have been “successful” with my results, but  isn’t everyone?  I train to win, but race for the passion.”</p>

				<p>How many runners have been told to stop running? It’s the same old story over and over again. An everyday runner goes to see their non-runner primary care physician for evaluation of pain in the  _______________(insert knee, foot, ankle, thigh, neck, back). The physician probes and prods and typically makes a diagnosis of Runners Knee, IT Band Syndrome, Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendonitis, Bursitis, Shin Splints, Lumbago, etc…. As a physician it is fair for me to say that we are instilled a very scientific doctrine in medical school… If it hurts when I do X then you should stop doing X.</p>
<p>While this doctrine holds true in a common sense way, it does not provide a satisfactory response to a runner. The running habit is strong. One of my friends really gets infuriated when people tell him to just bike. His response, “I hate biking, it does not make me happy”.</p>
<p>The most common myth that I hear from uninformed physicians and patients alike is that running will ruin your joints and cause arthritis. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23377837"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23377837', 'A 2013 cross-sectional study of 74,752 runners');"">A 2013 cross-sectional study of 74,752 runners</a> concluded that running actually reduced Osteoarthritis in the hip and need for hip replacement surgery. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.22939/abstract"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.22939/abstract', 'In a 2017 study of 2,637');"">In a 2017 study of 2,637</a> participants published in the Journal Arthritis Care &amp; Research found no correlation between running and arthritis of the knee.</p>
<p>Despite the slew of benefits that incorporating running into your life can have, it does come with some potential pitfalls. I hope you find value in the following tips to help reduce your risk of injury and maximize your enjoyment in the sport.</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid over training: This is one of the most common things I see in athletes that leads to injury and occurs when you either over stress your body from exertion or do not allow for proper rest and recovery between workouts. In the recent book <a href=""https://www.peakperformancebook.net"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.peakperformancebook.net', 'Peak Performance');""><em>Peak Performance</em></a> Magness and Stulberg present a growth equation growth=stress+rest. Interestingly enough, most find the rest portion of the equation more difficult to accomplish.</li>
</ol>
<p>To manage training stress I recommend using tools like heart rate monitors or running power meters to help athletes quantify what easy really is to them. I tend to agree with many of the philosophies presented by Dr. Phil Maffetone in <a href=""https://philmaffetone.com/product/big-book-endurance-training-racing/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://philmaffetone.com/product/big-book-endurance-training-racing/', 'The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing');""><em>The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing</em></a> and especially like his theory of training slower to race fast!</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Concentrate on form: One of the easiest ways to decrease impact on your joints is to shorten your stride. Any changes in running form should be done gradually. In my earlier days of distance running I was plagued by IT problems that went away once I purchased my first pair of Sir Issac Newtons in 2010. By focusing on increasing my cadence I quickly improved my running economy, decreased pain, and increased pace all without increasing my weekly miles. The book <a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/natural-running/danny-abshire-authors-book-on-natural-running/""><em>Natural Running</em></a> by Danny Abshire is a great reference for anyone interested in improving ones form.</li>
<li>Allow your body to properly warm-up: I was a child of the 90s where every practice started with a stretching circle. While that ritual of sitting around in a circle with my team was great, the scientific literature has not proven its effectiveness in preventing injuries for runners. Instead start your warm up by using exercise bands to activate your muscles. Once the muscles are activated you are ready to start an easy active warm up consisting of low intensity jogging. Remember that the shorter the race the longer the warm-up. After you are warm dynamic stretches and mobility drills will take you to the next level of performance.</li>
<li>Cross Train: Having an aerobic base is the foundation of endurance training. Until the foundation is poured it is impossible to build the fitness needed to perform on race day. The base is built over years and requires long hours of easy aerobic training. Cycling, ski touring, cross country skiing, hiking, walking, swimming, elliptical, or anything that gets you outside and puts a smile on your face while increasing your heart rate is a great thing to do. For my diehard road and track stars I recommend hitting some trails to work some different muscles.</li>
<li>Strength Training: Judging from my social media feed, runners are getting on board with strength training (or at least they like to take photos of themselves doing planks). A strong core, hips, and glutes are imperative to stay injury free. Quad strengthening can do wonders for knee pain.</li>
<li>Stay springy and agile: Mile after mile on the road can take a toll on your body and mobility. Runs should not leave you feeling stiff in rigid. Post workout recovery with stretching, message, and rolling work great. The goal here is to feel better after a run than you did before you started.</li>
<li>Nutrition: A healthy diet is based in real foods that aren’t processed. I typically only recommend supplements for those who are on a restrictive diet, have absorption problems (from disease or medications), or those with documented micronutrient deficiencies. The best way to get your micronutrients is by eating a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, and proteins. Supplements are for treating deficiencies! If you are concerned about a deficiency talk to you physician and draw some labs. People need to be mindful of everything they put into their bodies. You truly are what you eat. Just because a supplement is sold at a “health food store” doesn’t mean it is healthy. In my medical career I have seen multiple cases of Vitamin D and Calcium overdose.</li>
<li>General Health: Just because you’re a runner doesn’t mean you are immune to disease. I have treated many athletes who appear to be the picture of health from the outside, but have unaddressed chronic diseases that they were unaware of. Injury prevention is based in preventative medicine that is best accomplished by partnering with a physician.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly and most importantly :</p>
<p>Learn to listen to your body and act when things are not right. Small problems that are ignored can progress to debilitating injuries if not properly cared for.</p>

				<p>A conversation with <a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/harvey-lewis/"">Harvey Lewis</a>, Ultra Running National Champion, Vegan, Newtonite.</p>
<p>And <a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/justin-cogley/"">Justin Cogley</a>, Executive Chef, Former Professional Figure Skater, Current Ultrarunner, Newtonite</p>
<p><strong>The conversation started with Harvey giving an outline of his daily routine:</strong></p>
<p>“I average about 90 miles a week across the year but have been pushing closer to 100 miles a week. I’ve commuted back and forth to work both ways running for over 4 years now, so typically it’s important to eat something quick in the morning unless it’s a weekend, and then I can make something after a morning run for a brunch.</p>
<p>I often make sandwiches for lunch or take leftovers because it’s fast. I live alone in the city Monday to Friday and with my fiancé and her kids on the weekend. I often eat out Monday to Thursday because it’s not much more and it’s convenient. I do some longer runs in the evening 10-12 miles a few times a week when I’m not in a taper or recovery, and longer runs of 20-30 miles on the weekend this time of the year. I just finished a 241 mile run this week but feel pretty good thanks to my Newtons and good foods.”</p>
<p><strong>Justin responded with a daily meal plan that fits into Harvey’s Vegan diet, active lifestyle, and preference towards quick and convenient meal options:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Breakfast</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> “</strong>What I like about this dish is that both Harvey and I don’t have a whole lot of time in the mornings. You can make this ahead of time and the base will keep in the fridge for 4 days. To  rewarm just heat up and thin out with more soy, water, or nut milk of your choice. It is healthy and I find it a nice way to warm up on a chilly morning.”</p>
<p><strong>Amaranth cooked in chamomile tea, chopped toasted nuts, cashew milk </strong></p>
<p>4 cups water<br>
1 Tbsp chamomile tea<br>
1 cup amaranth<br>
1/2 cup cashew milk<br>
1 Tbsp maple syrup<br>
chopped toasted nuts (almonds, cashews, walnuts)</p>
<p>*First bring the water to a simmer and steep the loose leaf tea for 4 minutes. You could sub 2 tea bags of tea also. After the tea has stepped strain out the loose leaf tea, if using the tea bags just pull out. Now use this flavored base to cook the amaranth in, string every couple min until you have a nice porridge. Next, add the cashew milk and stir in until combined. Finally, finish with the toasted chopped nuts and maple syrup.</p>
<p>“I love this for a mid-day smoothie, it will help you not snack and hold you over to lunch/dinner. Plus with some pre-planning it takes minutes to put together.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Avocado, Frozen banana, maca root, almond milk, toasted sunflower seed </u></strong></p>
<p>(1 serving) plus extra<br>
1 avocado peeled and pitted (I prefer the hass variety)<br>
½ cup almond milk<br>
1 Tbsp powdered maca root<br>
1 Tbsp agave<br>
2 frozen sliced bananas (I just store in zip lock bags)<br>
a handful of spinach<br>
a small handful of marcona almonds<br>
a small handful of toasted sunflower seeds</p>
<p>*Blend all the ingredients in a blender and give it a try. You can always thin out with some more almond milk if needed.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Avacado-.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-6354 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Avacado--300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""276"" height=""281""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Lunch</span></strong></p>
<p>“Harvey Mentioned that he run commutes so this can easily be transported and built on your lunch site or even made into a salad. Everything can be made ahead of time and just takes some pre-planning. Then it is really easy to throw together last minute.”</p>
<p><strong><u>Shiso wraps with rice, pine nut “mayo” avocado, parsnips and carrots</u></strong></p>
<p>4-6 whole Shiso leaves (Whole foods or Asian market)<br>
1 cup cooked rice<br>
3 Tbsp pine nut “mayo” recipe below.<br>
1 ripe avocado (sliced)<br>
1 parsnip (peeled and grated)<br>
1 carrot (peeled and grated)<br>
hand full of sprouts (daikon, alfalfa, or pea)<br>
dash of Soy (Braggs)<br>
a dash of chili oil or hot sauce of your choice<br>
Salt to taste</p>
<p>*First take the cooked rice and put into a bowl and mix with the pine nut mayo, grated carrots, grated parsnips, soy, hot sauce, and salt.  First, lay the Shiso leaves on your work surface and spread the rice mixture on top. Next, add the slices of avocado to each one then top with the chili oil. Finally add the sprouts or greens to each one. You can pick up and eat like a taco!</p>
<p><strong><u>Pine Nut Mayonnaise</u></strong></p>
<p>Makes 1 cup</p>
<p>1/2 cup raw pine nuts, soaked for 3 hours in hot water and then drained<br>
1/4 cup filleted water<br>
1 Tbsp Olive oil<br>
1 Tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice<br>
Salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p>*In a Blender, add the pine nuts, water, olive oil, lemon juice and blend until smooth. The puree will get thicker as it cools. Make sure you season to taste.  Chill and then this will last 4 days in the fridge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Finally Harvey mentions that on the weekends he has more time to make some meals. This sauce works great and can be used for a number of different ideas. Again it is something that he can make ahead of time and just heat in the oven.”</p>
<p><strong><u>Celery root, apple, and mushroom enchilada sauce</u></strong></p>
<p>The sauce serves 4.</p>
<p><strong>For the Sauce.</strong></p>
<p>3 tablespoons olive oil<br>
1/4 cup Spanish onion, diced<br>
1 each shallot (peeled and diced)<br>
1 each apple (peeled and diced) Granny smith works well<br>
1 celery root (peeled and diced)<br>
1 cup of Crimini, portobello, chanterelle, or black trumpet mushroom (cleaned and chopped)<br>
2 teaspoon toasted cumin (ground)<br>
1 teaspoon toasted fennel seed (ground)<br>
1 or 2 each dried chipotle pepper (or your favorite)<br>
a few drops of apple vinegar<br>
salt to taste.<br>
water or stock to cover</p>
<p>*Warm a medium size pot over low heat until warm.  Next, Sweat the onions and garlic in the olive oil for about 5 min until they soften. Next, add the apple, celery root and mushrooms. When the vegetables start to release their liquid add the spices and the peppers. Finally, cover the vegetables with water or stock and let cook at a simmer for about 20 minutes. After 20 min or until all the vegetables are soft blend in a blender until smooth. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning as necessary with salt, pepper, and vinegar.</p>
<p>“Now you can roll your favorite vegetables in warmed corn tortillas or even sliced celery root. I like cauliflower, mushrooms, celery root ect… Put the enchiladas in a baking dish and cover with the sauce. Now you can add some vegan grated cheese, herbs, fried pumpkin seeds then bake in a 350 degree oven for around 20 min. Enjoy or chill and save for the next day.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/enchilada.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-6351 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/enchilada-300x151.jpg"" alt="""" width=""347"" height=""171""></a></p>
<p>“If you have more time, here is a fun brunch idea that you can have the kids help with:”</p>

				<p>By <a href=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/bryan-cox/"">Bryan Cox</a>, Retired Marine, Warrior, Newtonite</p>
<p>As a 22 year retired Marine, Veterans Day means something different to me than it may mean to someone else. I was a helicopter tail gunner while on active duty and we had a lot of devices to help us along the way like night vision goggles and overhead surveillance. Most of the men and women who fought before us did not have that luxury, as a matter a fact, some only had a six digit grid coordinate. And they fought, bravely and courageously without hesitation. Some where treated with disrespect returning home and some didn’t even make it home. Veterans Day to me is a day to honor those warriors who went before us. I honor them everyday, it was my honor to fight for them and to honor the legacy they have left behind. Honestly I don’t do anything different than any other day. I get a lot of phone calls, texts, emails, and Facebook messages thanking me for my service, which is a nice gesture and I appreciate all of them. For me though, every time I see that older hero walking in the mall or someone with the Vietnam or Korean War Veteran hat on, I will go up and introduce myself and thank them for the legacy they bestowed on me as a warrior.</p>
<p>Joining the Marine Corps was an easier decision for me than most. I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and in the early 90’s, Louisville wasn’t going anywhere. After high school I started working at UPS and met a guy there that was in the Marine Corps. We talked, and the next thing you know I was signing up. It was mainly to get away from Louisville. Now, after two plus decades away, Louisville is a great little city and still growing. Who knows what would’ve happened if I hadn’t left. I got a chance to see the world, both good and bad. I lived in San Diego for close to 20 years and I was introduced to Newton Running. I think I made a wise choice.</p>
<p>Honor, Courage, and Commitment, it’s the trademark of the Marine Corps. I look at it like this, honor those that have fought before you, have the courage to stand up for yourself, others, and what is right, and commit fully to what you’re doing. Sure I learned a million other things from the Corps but those three are pressed in to you from day one that they never leave.</p>

<p>I was stationed in Pensacola, Florida 2005-2008 as the senior enlisted Marine for the Naval Aircrew Candidate School. We trained Marines and Sailors to be physically, medically, aquatically, and mentally prepared to be Naval Aircrewman. I was approached by two other instructors about doing a triathlon and at first I thought, no way, I can’t do all of that. Needless to say I was talked in to doing the Mullet Man Triathlon and like most people the rest has been history!</p>

<p>For 2018 my first goal is to heal from my hamstring tear. As long as that goes smoothly I am signed up for Chattanooga 70.3, two local half marathons and four local triathlons. Pending rehab I am going to do Ohio 70.3 and Haines City 70.3. My fiancé and I are also planning a swim/ run event. Also in 2018 as I have done since 2007, I plan on spreading the word about Newton Running and supporting the brand as much as possible. I see big things on the horizon for the company and I’m super stoked to be apart of it!</p>

<p>Proving once again that he can run down anyone, Crowie smoked the field in the marathon to win the 2009 Ford Ironman World Championships with a time of 8:20:21. Crowie came out of T2 in 10th place and more than 12 minutes behind the leader Chris Lieto. Digging deep and throwing down at 2:48 marathon, Crowie chased down such stars as Normann Stadler and Chris McCormack, broke away from Andreas Raelert at the Energy Lab, and passed Chris Lieto at mile 21 to go on to victory. The conditions were tough – hotter than hell and not a breeze to be found. It was an outstanding race – congratulations to all competitors!</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> shoes were spotted all over the place last week on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. As runners descended on Waikiki for the Dec. 13 Honolulu Marathon, dozens of runners were seen sporting Newton Running racers and trainers, both in pre-race shag runs and during the race. And a week prior to the marathon, Newton runners could be seen in the Xterra Trail Run World Championships, an event that drew 1,100 runners to the pristine mountain and rainforest terrain of Kualoa Ranch on the north side of the island. (If you’ve seen the movies<em> Jurassic Park, Windtalkers, Pearl Harbor, Godzilla, Tears of the Sun</em> or <em>50 First Dates</em> or the hit TV show <em>LOST</em> (which were all filmed on this 400-acre working cattle ranch) then you have an idea of the kind of terrain trail runners encountered. Heather Fuhr (third among women, 1:38:01) and Rachel Cieslewicz (seventh, 1:42:13) were among the top Newton runners in the event. Aloha, baby!</p>

				<p>Earlier this week, the New York Times published an interesting story about a common injury that many, many runners suffer from – stress fractures. The article references a new study published in the journal <em>Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise </em>which, “offers hope that, at least for runners, simple alterations in their stride or in the strength of their legs might reduce their risk for the most common type of stress fracture.”</p>
<p>We encourage you to read<a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/phys-ed-how-to-prevent-stress-fractures/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/phys-ed-how-to-prevent-stress-fractures/', ' the whole article');"" target=""_blank""> the whole article</a>, but here’s the most salient point:</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">“The researchers determined that reducing stride length by about 10 percent seemed to reduce the stress on the tibia enough to lower the risk of a stress fracture. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Why, though, should shortening your stride affect your tibia at all? “Think of it this way,” says Brent Edwards, lead author of the study and now a post-doctoral research fellow in the Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition at the University of Illinois, in Chicago. “If you spend less time in the flight phase of running” — meaning in the air — “you’ll hit the ground with less force.” On the other hand, you’ll hit the ground more often. But in Mr. Edwards’s models, the reduction in pounding from an abbreviated stride outweighed the shock from a few additional strides per mile.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333399;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Shortening your stride is one of the key tenets of the proper running form that Newton teaches. Running coaches like Danny Abshire have known for years that over-striding can lead to injuries, and now it’s nice to have some empirical data to back it up.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333399;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Also, here’s a great image the Denver Post ran a few months ago that illustrates many of the benefits of proper natural running form.</span></span></p>

				<p>We stumbled upon this fun story of a budding (?) relationship from blogger <a href=""http://lolarunner.blogspot.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://lolarunner.blogspot.com/', 'Lola Runs');"" target=""_blank"">Lola Runs</a>, who is chronicling her adventures in the world of online dating on her blog. LolaRuns’s second date with ‘BoyGenius’ turns into a discussion of natural running form and Newton Running shoes. Will true love ensue?</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">LolaRuns goes on a second date with BoyGenius</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">One day after LolaRuns first date with BoyGenius, BoyGenius text LolaRuns to request a second date. A second date would be lovely LolaRuns responded.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">Throughout the week, leading up to the date schedule for Friday, November 13, BoyGenius and LolaRuns text about BoyGenius’s running program and Newton running shoes. Please recall that LolaRuns hasn’t been running because of a pounding ache in her lower back when she attempts to run. When LolaRuns shared this information with BoyGenius during the first date, he immediately peppered her with questions and concluded that it was her running form that was producing the back problems.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">Him: “What is your running style? How do you land? Are you a heel striker?”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">Me: “I tend to lean back and strike with my heel.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">Him: “It’s your running form. You need Newton running shoes. They have a patented technology with exposed grooves that encourages mid to forefront running. Let’s walk over to the Potomac Running store and I will show the shoes to you. You have to strike with your midfoot or forefoot if you want to run healthily.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">This is where cute BoyGenius even demonstrated the proper running form while walking on Market Street. LolaRuns was a bit smitten at that point.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000080;"">The texts during the week followed the same vein with questions about LolaRuns workout – the stairclimber for an hour for the past two months – and the new Newton training shoes that would be available in the next month. BoyGenius also encouraged LolaRuns to check out the Newton web site and watch all the videos – which LolaRuns promptly and attentively reviewed. LolaRuns was sold on the Newtons – and quite possibly on BoyGenius.</span></p>

<p>At the start of the first American running boom in the 1970s, most people were running in fairly lightweight shoes that consisted of a rubber outsole a thin foam midsole and a lightweight nylon upper. Although simple by today’s standards, some of those early shoes were pretty good at allowing the foot to move naturally without the need for excessive muscular force and allowed a runner to obtain afferent feedback from each foot’s interaction with the ground.</p>
<p>As footwear technology advanced over the years, running shoes generally became cushier, softer, thicker, heavier and, in some respects even more comfortable. But, while some of the innovations were driven by performance, the end result in many cases was anything but performance-oriented. And that’s why, 30 years later, thousands of runners run with inefficient mechanics predicated on a heel-striking gait. Not only is that form not optimal for running fast, it can also lead to numerous overuse injuries.</p>
<p>The biggest culprit of modern running shoe design is that most training shoes have large, overbuilt heel crash pads that encourage and really only allow a heel-striking gait. Even if you wanted to run with a natural midfoot/forefoot stride pattern, the geometry and heel height of many shoes will not allow your foot to land naturally or parallel to the ground because the hefty heel gets in the way.</p>
<p><strong>What is Natural Running?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, natural running is the way the human body was meant to run in its purest form – namely, barefoot – across a solid surface. That means running with efficient mechanics centered around landing lightly on the midfoot/forefoot (the ball of the foot, but not the toes) and quickly lifting your foot off the ground instead of pushing off with excessive muscular force.</p>
<p>In order to accommodate that style of running, a runner needs to be able to feel the ground and interact with it accordingly just as when <strong>barefoot</strong>.</p>
<p>And to do that, the runner needs to be wearing lightweight, minimally designed running shoes. The afferent feedback from feeling the ground encourages your body to run with light footsteps, upright posture, a relaxed arm swing and a slight forward lean.</p>
<p>That important feedback is obtainable via minimalist, lightweight running shoes designed to allow the foot to strike the ground with a natural <strong>midfoot/forefoot gait</strong> but is impossible to receive wearing thickly cushioned shoes and a heavy heel-striking gait. Practicing natural running form can be simple, but it may take time to unlearn old habits and learn proper technique. Ultimately, natural running can help make a runner stronger, more efficient and less prone to overuse injuries.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Minimalist Shoes? </strong></p>
<p>Minimalism in its simplest form involves picking shoes that allow the foot to move more naturally than standard shoes allow. But not all minimal shoes are created equal. Newton Running shoes were designed to be an extension of the feet, enhancing ground contact without the jarring impact shock of the road, sidewalk or hard-packed trail below.</p>
<p>Newton’s reduced heel height and sleek geometry allows the shoe to stay out of the way as it approaches the contact with the ground, and along with enhanced forefoot communication, allows the runner to strike lightly at the midfoot/forefoot instead of using a heel-striking motion that requires heavy breaking and excess muscular force.</p>
<p>Newton Running’s patented <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/science/action-reaction-technology?utm_source=GO&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=ShoeGeometry"" target=""_blank"">Action/Reaction Technology™</a> encourages natural running or a barefoot running gait and enhances the shock absorbency, leverage and energy return throughout the gait cycle, ultimately helping achieve a faster cadence and more efficient mechanics. Newton’s <a title=""Shoe Lab Test Results"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/science/shoe-test-results"" target=""_blank"">independent lab research shows</a> the system returns up to 28 percent more energy and reduces impact up to 44 percent when compared to training and racing shoes offered by leading running brands.</p>
<p>Practicing <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/optimal-running-form?utm_source=GO&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=ShoeGeometry"" target=""_blank"">natural running form</a> can be simple, but it may take time to unlearn old habits and learn proper technique. But it also requires having the appropriate footwear to allow your body to run the way it was designed to run. Once you learn to run naturally, you’ll put yourself in position to run faster and healthier for the rest of your life.</p>

Here are a few thoughts that our Director of Education, Ian Adamson, would like to add to the dialogue:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are several on-going, multi-year studies at Harvard, MIT and the University of Newcastle (AUS) that are looking at injury related to footwear. Harvard department of Anthropology is about to publish a study that dissects unshod human running gait and injury (or lack thereof.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the only injury from running shoes is Achilles tendinitis, is the implication that the other “running related injuries” such as neuromas, plantar fascitis, blisters, bunions and joint problems would be present in if people didn’t run?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Shoe Geometry Affects Running Gait</strong></p>
<p>I’m on the front line seeing runners who present with all of the above and more, and the vast majority are treatable with appropriate shoes (the closer a shoe reflects the geometry of the foot the better, although protection from man-made and unnatural surfaces is prudent), especially a lower heel/ramp angle combined with proper form coaching.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in <a href=""http://www.ianadamson.com/Ian_Adamson/Home.html"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ianadamson.com/Ian_Adamson/Home.html', 'my experience');"" title=""IanAdamson.com"" target=""_blank"">my experience</a> (running competitively since 1973, 12 years as a professional athlete, 10 years in the shoe industry, 10 years as a bio-mechanical engineer) that lifted heels in running shoes introduce an <a title=""Shoe Geometry 101"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/improve-your-running/276-shoe-geometry-101"" target=""_blank"">unnatural geometry</a> that interferes with our natural (and injury protective) gait.</p>
<p><strong>Ramp Angle Comparison in Minimalist Shoes</strong></p>
<p>It would take a lot to convince me that strapping 1/2 to 1″ foam to your heel doesn’t alter your stride. If you cut virtually any running shoe lengthwise you can see the drop from heel to the ball of the foot. The Nike Shox as noted above is one of the worst offenders. It used to be that 24 mm heel height (1 inch) and 12 mm (1/2″) forefoot was standard, but those numbers have changed dramatically in the last few years. Some popular running shoes are up to 35 mm in the heel. <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong><br>
</strong></span><br>
The old standard drop (24-12) gives an 8% grade in a Men’s US size 9 shoe, but most are now far in excess of that, up to 15% in some cases. An 8% road grade (rise/ run as a %) is where most states give truckers a warning. Racing flats can be better in terms of being more level, but virtually none are actually level. The best on the market are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vibram (2 mm differential = 1.3%)</li>
<li><a title=""Newton Performance Racer"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/newton-products/the-shoes/mens-shoes/men-racers/men-neutral-racer-09"" target=""_blank"">Newton Performance Racer</a> (2 mm/1.3%)</li>

<li><a title=""Newton Guidance Trainers"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/newton-products/the-shoes/mens-shoes/men-guidance-trainer"" target=""_blank"">Newton Guidance Trainers</a> (5 mm/3.3 %)</li>
<li>Asics Piranha 3 (6 mm/4.0%)</li>
<li>Biom (8 mm/5.3%)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to note that some perceived “flat” shoes are not: Nike Free 5.0 (10 mm/6.7%), Nike Zoom Streak XC (11 mm/7.3 %), Nike Luna Racer (12 mm/8.0%), Brooks T6 (13 mm/8.7%). On the other end of the spectrum, the Brooks Beast has a 16 mm drop and 10.7% grade.</p>
<p>My personal experience: ran track and cross country barefoot and injury free through high school. Ran in Dunlop Volley tennis shoes through college (no heel lift <a href=""http://www.volleys.com.au/flash/index.html"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.volleys.com.au/flash/index.html', 'http://www.volleys.com.au/flash/index.html');"" target=""_blank"">http://www.volleys.com.au/flash/index.html</a>), injury free. Was given a “modern” running shoe with a heel lift by a sponsor in 1989 and sustained my first running related injuries. Started back with level shoes again in 2007 (Newton) and viola, injuries gone.</p>

<p><em>By Danny Abshire, co-founder, <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a></em></p>
<p>Do you think a running shoe with a thickly cushioned heel pad and rigid medial post can keep you from suffering common running injuries such as plantar fasciitis, iliotibial band syndrome or shin splits? Think again.</p>
<p>Recent research and news reports are confirming what those close to the sport have known for years: running shoes with thick midsoles, extensive anti-pronation devices and large heel crash pads don’t prevent injuries.</p>
<p>The key to preventing running injuries is to run with lightweight shoes and <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/run-better/"" target=""_blank"">efficient, low-impact running form</a>. Running in heavy, overbuilt running shoes can put more strain on a runner’s body, reduce proprioception necessary to engage proper form and make a runner’s feet and lower legs overwork braking and propulsive muscles and connective tissue — a combination which can actually make a runner more prone to common overuse injuries.</p>
<p>A recent study at the University of Newcastle in Australia concluded there is no scientific evidence to support claims that running shoes with elevated heel crash pads and elaborate anti-pronation systems prevent injuries in runners. The findings have been published in the March 2009 edition of the British Journal of Sports Medicine.</p>
<p>“Since the 1980s, distance running shoes with thick, heavily cushioned heels and features to control how much the heel rolls in, have been consistently recommended to runners who want to avoid injury,” Dr. Craig Richards, one of the researchers, said in a press release announcing the results of the study. “We did not identify a single study that has attempted to measure the effect of this shoe type on either injury rates or performance. This means there is no scientific evidence that [those shoes] provide any benefit to distance runners.”</p>
<p>Dutch researchers have previously found that between 37 and 56 percent of recreational runners become injured at least once each year. The most common maladies are found in the feet and lower legs, but others include pelvis and lower back injuries.</p>
<p>“Not only can we no longer recommend a shoe [with an elevated heel and pronation control system], but the lack of research in this area means that we cannot currently make any evidence-based shoe recommendations to runners,” Richards said in the release. “To resolve this uncertainty, running shoes need to be tested like any other medical treatment, in carefully controlled clinical trials.</p>
<p>“This will ensure that only running shoes with proven benefits can be marketed and sold as therapeutic devices. Until this occurs, health professionals will not know whether the distance running shoes they are recommending are beneficial, harmless or harmful.”</p>

That story referenced Dr. Daniel Lieberman, professor of biological anthropology at Harvard University, who offered the startling conclusion that: “A lot of foot and knee injuries currently plaguing us are caused by people running with shoes that actually make our feet weak, cause us to overpronate (ankle rotation) and give us knee problems.”</p>
<p>To run efficiently, you have to understand your body and how it naturally moves across a surface with as little muscular force as possible. The tenants of good running form include running with short strides and a quick cadence, landing lightly on the midfoot/forefoot area (the ball of the foot, but not the toes), and quickly lifting your foot off the ground instead of pushing off with excessive muscle force. A slight forward lean and a relaxed arm swing are also key components.</p>
<p>To illustrate what Newton Running calls the “Land-Lever-Lift” technique, take the simple test of running barefoot across a smooth floor. More than likely, you’re naturally going to land lightly at your midfoot/forefoot and quickly pick up your foot to start a new stride. Your body doesn’t allow you to land on your heels because it isn’t engineered to accommodate the blunt force trauma of repeated heel striking. Unfortunately, most contemporary running shoes have been designed for running form that demands heavy heel striking and dampens the afferent feedback which allows the foot to sense the ground.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest mistakes distance runners can fall prey to are 1) excessive heel striking that causes abrupt braking of forward momentum, and then pushing off too hard with the toes to start the forward motion again; or 2) using only propulsive muscles,(the calf group, hamstrings and Achilles tendon) by running too far up on their toes like a sprinter and not using the body’s natural cushioning system. Each of those form flaws puts too much vertical movement into every stride, and that leads to inefficiency and considerably more impact, muscle and tendon stress on the body.</p>

				<p>Another big weekend of racing for Team Newton. Crowie, Michellie, Heather Fuhr and Josh Cox were all busy….</p>
<p>“As the Crow flies”<br>
Current Ironman World Champion, Craig “Crowie” Alexander has recorded another scorching victory, this time in the Ironman 70.3 Hawaii. A flying final run leg saw him claw back an 8 minute lead to highly regarded American Chris Lieto, to find his way home first and clinch another title on the hallowed shores of the Kona coast.</p>
<p>Fellow Australian Luke McKenzie, Chris Lieto, local Timothy Marr and Alexander were together after the frantic frolic swim in the North Pacific. It was Lieto though who pushed to an early lead on the volcanic cycle route to Hawi as he has done so many times before. Whilst a flock that included Alexander, McKenzie and Marr jostled into the final transition together, assailant Lieto was well out of sight and ensured a white hot run race pace in the Big Island’s steamy conditions.</p>
<p>As Alexander proved last year in October, his foot speed is difficult to match as he seems to float over the hot surfaces of Hawaii and his timing impeccable. A fast finishing run of 1:17:12 and overall finish time of 4:02:52 demonstrated he is well on course to take his 2008 achievements to new heights. Lieto held on for second place in 4:05:34. Whilst McKenzie had the second best run of the day, 1:26:26 and was welcomed across the line third in 4:11:58.</p>
<p>Alexander will now base himself at altitude in Boulder Colorado for the next 4 months, focusing on a hectic North American season before for he and his family migration back to Hawaii for the Ironman World Championships later in the season.</p>
<p>Craig’s next race is still being decided, but he is anticipating some less taxing temperatures but another tough hit out.</p>
<p>================================================</p>
<p>Michellie Jones wins the Orange County Duathlon, on May 30, 2009.   She continues on her quest for speed – and it looks like it is being successful.<br>
Next up for Michellie is the Escape From Alcatraz event – where she is an 8x winner.</p>
<p>================================================<br>
To round out the weekend – Heather Fuhr steps into the Rock N Roll Marathon San Diego.  Finishing in 2:48.29 good enough for a 6th Place finish.  This was Fuhr’s first ever stand alone road marathon.</p>
<p>Josh Cox also ran part of the RnR Marathon –  helping pace Tom Bedford, (son of former 10,000m world record holder &amp; London Marathon director Dave Bedford), in an effort to raise funds for the <a href=""http://www.entoto.org/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.entoto.org/', 'Entoto Foundation');"" target=""_blank"">Entoto Foundation</a>. Tom needs to run sub 2:25 (details are on the site).  Josh brought Tom through the ½ marathon right on pace at:  1:12.01.   Tom was unsuccessful in his bid to run 2:25, but finished the race none the less in a respectable 2:47.45</p>

<p>Two weeks ago at Ruby Hill Park in Denver, Ironman World Champion and Boulder resident (for the northern summer at least) Craig Alexander met with the Rocky Mountain Triathlon Club for a meet and greet.  Newton founder, Danny Abshire spoke with the group about the dynamics of midfoot running, and how Newton Running shoes can be an asset.  Also sponsoring the event was Runner’s Roost in Denver, who showed up with a van full of Newton shoes to try on and sell.  The night was capped off with a team run with Craig leading the way as they did hill repeats – a great turnout and a great night for all.</p>

<p>This morning we received a very in-depth Newton shoe review from Dr. Christopher Segler, a renowned podiatrist, foot surgeon and Iromnan finisher based in Chattanooga.</p>
<p>The full review is posted below, but for the time-challenged, here’s his overall impression:</p>
<p><em>“I can say that for me personally, I believe <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-gravity-v-b"">Newton Running Gravity’s</a> are proving to be a valuable training tool and are changing the way I run for the better. As an award-winning podiatrist and foot surgeon caring for athletes, I would recommended Newtons to any of my patients who have had a history of injury, or simply hope to run more efficiently.  It seems the greatest benefit is, of course, for those demanding efficiency such as marathoners and Ironman triathletes.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Newton Running Shoe Review</strong><br>
by Dr. Christopher Segler</p>
<p><strong>Why I Decided to Write This Review</strong></p>
<p>There are really two reasons I decided to write this review of <a title=""Newton Running"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-running-shoes"" target=""_blank"">Newton Gravity’s</a>. The first has to do with the fact that I am an award-winning foot surgeon and podiatrist who has chosen to limit my practice to elite, competitive and recreational athletes. For this reason, I get questions about running shoes from a lot of runners.  I am frequently asked about “<a title=""Newton's Take on Barefoot Running"" href=""/blog/natural-running/newtons-take-on-barefoot-running/"">new trends in barefoot running</a>” as well as about shoes like Newtons that reportedly create more of a barefoot-type running experience. I always prefer to answer such questions on the basis of scientific theory as well as personal experience.</p>
<p>The second reason is that I am an age-group Ironman triathlete who has aspirations of qualifying for Kona one day. So I have a very personal interest in discovering any and every way to increase my own biomechanical efficiency, decrease my risk of injury, and run faster.  Newtons (in theory) should to do all three, so I thought I should give them a try.</p>
<p><strong><span id=""more-1002""></span>First Impressions</strong></p>
<p>As I opened the box and lifted my brand new Newtons from their tissue-paper nest, the scent of new running shoes filled the air.  And these shoes felt light as air themselves.  I was extremely surprised to sense that these “trainers” actually felt quite a bit lighter than any other pair of running shoes I have ever owned.  I also noticed the generous use of mesh in the uppers. While this certainly helps keep them light, I was also pleased because my feet are always hot. And in my shoes, there can never be too much cooling aeration.</p>
<p>In looking at the soles, the four forefoot lugs caught my eye.  They protruded slightly more that the rest of the forefoot and heel. This, of course, is the business end of the Newton Running concept; where science meets the road, so to speak.  It was obvious looking at the profile of the shoe, that the lugs should make it easier to land on the forefoot instead of the heel. I figured if these shoes don’t get me to land on the forefoot, nothing else will.</p>
<p><strong>Science or Gimmick?</strong></p>
<p>Naming your product after the Father of Physics creates a pretty big pair of shoes to fill. After all, the laws of physics set some pretty strict rules to follow. There is a section on the Newton Running website that lays out all of the <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/technology/"" target=""_blank"">technology</a> behind Newton Running shoes. Within that section is a distillation of the laws of physics that affect all runners. Basically, it describes the science without all of the cumbersome math usually associated with physics.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, running is all about energy. And there is only so much to get you from start to finish. You must use your energy to cover ground. If you land on your heel and slow down, you use up valuable energy in braking. If you then have to re-accelerate to get going again, you use up more energy. This leaves you with less energy to get you to the finish in good form.</p>
<p>The Newton Running “<a title=""Action/Reaction Technology"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/technology/"" target=""_blank"">Action/Reaction Technology”</a> is part of the patented components of Newton Running shoes and is one of Newton’s proposed keys to stop wasting energy and thereby start running more efficiently and faster. By writing this review, I hope to determine whether or not this is true and if the shoes can actually live up to Sir Isaac’s name.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations vs. Experience</strong></p>
<p>When I first read about Newtons I was skeptical. I understand that all energy lost in a running stride, in theory, could be harnessed and returned.  But when I first heard this notion applied to the elastomeric lugs on Newton running shoes, I envisioned Wile E. Coyote with coiled bedsprings attached to his feet bounding down a desert highway in pursuit of the Roadrunner. But I put my imagination aside and decided to trust the voice of reason and experience.</p>
<p>When I first laced them up, I noted a perfect fit.  As a men’s size 12.5, I seem to (more often than not) have trouble finding shoes that run true to size.  For that reason alone, I am always sheepish about ordering shoes online. The Newton Running website claims that shoes should be ordered “true to size” and they were precisely that. Great fit!</p>
<p>Standing in my Newtons, the most perceptible difference (as compared to my old running shoes) was a slightly lower heel height. This, of course, is also by design. It’s really partly a lower heel, but more a relative drop from the thicker lugs on the forefoot.  But I realized that in order to run faster, more efficiently, and get to Kona, I would need to learn to more consistently avoid landing on my heels anyway.</p>
<p><strong>The <a title=""Finding Your Foot Type"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/why-newton/choose-a-shoe"" target=""_blank"">Right Shoe for My Foot Type</a></strong></p>
<p>With the first few steps, the shoes felt soft and cushy. Given my high-arched “rectus” foot type (most often referred to as “neutral” or incorrectly termed “supinated”), I knew I would appreciate the give in these shoes.</p>
<p>For anyone with a rectus foot type, cushioning is key.  The reason is because a person with a lack of pronation (the opposite of a “pronated foot” or flatfoot) simply cannot absorb impact effectively when the foot hits the ground.</p>
<p>One way to describe pronation is to say that it is the motion in the joints of the foot that absorbs energy as the arch collapses. But in my case, in a sense, the joints are locked. There is an absence of pronation during walking and running.  This means higher impact and higher risk of injuries such as stress fractures, shin splints and some types of tendonitis.</p>
<p><strong>How Newtons Might Help Me Run</strong></p>
<p>The <a title=""Newton Running"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-gravity-v-b"" target=""_blank"">Newton Gravity </a> has the potential to help lower my risk of injury in two ways. First, the lugs are soft and provide ample impact reduction to compensate for my biomechanical deficiencies in terms of using my joints to absorb energy through pronation (this is important). Second, they should be able to convert my running style to one that reduces the impact the road will deliver to my chassis (this is more important).</p>
<p>The highest impact that a runner can sustain is by landing on the heels. The higher the arches, the higher the impact. Every time the foot lands heel-first out in front of the runner, a braking force is applied by the foot and lower leg. This slows the runner. The energy loss is essentially converted to friction, heat and that pounding sensation hammering through your legs.</p>
<p>By contrast, when you land on your forefoot, the 26 bones, 33 joints and more than 100 muscles, tendons and ligaments work together to absorb that impact. By landing on the part of the foot that is by nature more flexible, the force is spread out and dissipated more naturally.</p>
<p>This is where the barefoot running concept comes in. It is well known that barefoot runners land on the forefoot and never on the heels. Landing on the heels is a learned behavior resulting from a lifetime of reliance upon shoes. Barefoot runners simply run more efficiently and should be at lower risk of injury.</p>
<p>But you cannot just go run barefoot and expect to become someone who has the running style of a life-time barefoot runner. First, the risk of injuries such as stress fracture and tendonitis is very high when running barefoot. Second, you still have to train the brain to restructure your stride to run “like” a barefoot runner.</p>
<p><strong>The First Ride on My Newtons</strong></p>
<p>With the first few strides I immediately noted something unusual. I was landing on my forefoot.</p>
<p>After reading the instruction card that says the goal should be to “land, lever and lift,” I assumed that I would have to put a lot of effort into landing on the forefoot, levering off of the lugs (without pushing off with my toes) and finally lifting my knees and feet. But in fact it was all very simple and natural.</p>
<p>I tried to focus on keeping a high cadence and short stride, leaning forward slightly at the ankles. And just like that, I was landing more consistently on my forefoot. The few times I landing on the heels, it felt rather unnatural. This is likely due to the excess stretch of the Achilles tendon. As promised, the shoes were gently keeping me off of my heels.</p>
<p><strong>Break-in Time</strong></p>
<p>Having gotten my new Newtons only a couple of weeks before Ironman Louisville, I knew I wouldn’t have time to adequately break them in before the race. These shoes require a slightly more conservative break-in period.</p>
<p>I wore my Newton’s for five runs of 2 miles before I tried anything longer. Then three miles, then four and so on. Before long I was out on the road for a 10 mile run. I am pleased to say that my first 10-mile run in the Newtons went very smoothly. I was relaxed and felt like I was moving well. And in fact I was. I can honestly report that it was the easiest 10 mile run I have had this year. Maybe it only felt that way because I had recently recovered from an Ironman, or maybe I am becoming a more efficient runner.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Impression</strong></p>
<p>I can say that for me personally, I believe <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-gravity-v-b"" target=""_blank"">Newton Gravity’s </a>are proving to be a valuable training tool and are changing the way I run for the better. As an award-winning podiatrist and foot surgeon caring for athletes, I would recommended Newtons to any of my patients who have had a history of injury, or simply hope to run more efficiently.  It seems the greatest benefit is, of course, for those demanding efficiency such as marathoners and Ironman triathletes.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, I am doing all of my long runs, bricks and speed workouts with Newtons. No pain, no injuries and no complaints. I love my Newtons. In about six weeks I will apply the true test: Ironman Florida.  I plan to run the race in them and will post a follow-up review to update you on my progress. With the changes I have seen thus far, I am fully expecting to set a substantial new run split personal record. Who ever said physics can’t be fun!</p>

				<p>Forefoot pain, also known as “Metatarsalgia,” is a condition indicated by pain and inflammation under the ball of the foot. This is increasingly prevalent in runners who are making a change to minimal footwear, barefoot running and <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running Shoes</a>.</p>
<p>As with virtually all running injuries, forefoot pain is a result of doing too much, too fast, too soon. When people blame the shoes, consider whether they would have had the same thing happen running barefoot or in minimalist footwear? It’s a lot like saying “this helmet injured my head”, “this oven mitt burned my hand” or “these shorts tore my ham string.”</p>
<p>The bio-mechanical sensor plate in all Newton Shoes can lead people to believe the shoes are too hard and stress their feet. It actually works the other way around. The midsoles of regular running shoes are unnaturally soft (compared to the natural surfaces we evolved to run on), commonly leading to large, uneven depressions where the EVA foam collapses. Unlike Newton’s Action/Reaction technology, EVA never fully recovers, leaving an uneven surface under the foot.</p>
<p>The unfortunate result for many runners is misaligned metatarsals as the foot adapts to the soft surface and digs increasingly deeper holes into their shoes. Over years and decades it is common for people to end up with badly misaligned bones, like uneven keys on an old piano. Returning to a naturally firm surface like barefoot, minimal or Newton Shoes can be a painful experience as the bones realign, pulling on connective tissue and stressing the nerves.</p>
<p>Leaving the condition untreated can lead to other problems such as stress fractures of the metatarsals or Morton’s <a href=""http://newtonrunning.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7647d11b556f1428402471fc&amp;id=d6e8e65320&amp;e=38cff56b3d"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://newtonrunning.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7647d11b556f1428402471fc&amp;id=d6e8e65320&amp;e=38cff56b3d', 'Morton’s Neuroma');"">Morton’s Neuroma</a>. As with most medical conditions, the cause should be removed (often too much too soon) and then treated. Once addresses, it is important to ensure good running form and appropriate running shoes, with a conservative amount of time to adapt.</p>

				<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">For the past two years, the Ice Rink at One Boulder Plaza holds a broomball tournament to raise money for Community Food Share and each year Team Newton takes to the ice with high hopes. In case you’re not sure what broomball is, it’s like hockey but played with shoes instead of skates, a size 1 soccer ball instead of a puck and a “broom” instead of a stick.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Team Manager, Rich Miyamoto, watching from the sidelines has written an excellent play-by-play of Team Newton’s road to the championship game:</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Last night was the broomball extravaganza we have all been anticipating and Team Newton was amazing!!! </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> In the first game we played Reuben’s Burger Bistro, who were huge! Rumors were they were stacked with hockey players and would likely crush us…  Coach Dan “I love Grills” Grundy (dressed in his best Bill Belichick hoodie impersonation) fired the team up with a pre-game perspirational speech that would have definitely made the difference for the Pat’s in this years Super Bowl…</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">The pumped up Newton team lead by The Jerry took the ice and calling The Jerry panther-like would be a complete understatement.  If you can maybe visualize a Crazed CEO with years of pent up energy from working at his desk 100 hours a week with the unthinkable idea of building a company to make running shoes to compete with the big boys (now that would be a crazy man!!) and then releasing it all one night on one poor unsuspecting broomball team…I know that is a picture too frightening to even imagine and makes you want to close your eyes or look away, but that is exactly what would best describe The Jerry last night! The poor Burger giants were faced with their worst nightmare and by half time The Jerry took himself out of the game to spare them total humiliation.  All who were there will forever have the story to tell their children of the night they witnessed the Crazed CEO…Final score: 6-0!!!!</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> The next game was against Occipital who just destroyed last years runner-up team and you could hear them calling out actual plays during warmups!!!  They were also giants. (Does everyone except Newton eat at Rueben’s Burger Bistro everyday?).</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">The Jerry decided it was unfair to the other teams for him to continue to play so he retired from the tournament, leaving a huge gaping hole in Newtons chances…  How would we compete?  Coach Grills had the solution…he would be a player coach and play goalie!!! Later he would confess that he went into that zen state of mind and imagined the ball was chicken, hamburger, steak…you got it…all things to grill!!! Brilliant!!! He gobbled them up and the frustrated Occipital giants could not score!!….but unfortunately neither could we.  Shootout!</span></p>
<div id=""attachment_3442"" style=""max-width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMGP0058.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3442"" title=""Team MVP, Hawk Wathen"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMGP0058-300x224.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""224"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMGP0058-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMGP0058-1024x768.jpg 1024w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px""></a><p class=""wp-caption-text""> <span style=""color: #000000;"">Team MVP, Hawk Wathen</span></p></div>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> Team Newton finally met its match in the championship game against the host The Rink team.  This is definitely a team that was stacked with actual skilled hockey players, many of whom play on the <a href=""http://cubuffshockey.org/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://cubuffshockey.org/', 'University of Colorado Hockey Team');"" style=""color: #000000;"" title=""University of Colorado Hockey"" target=""_blank"">University of Colorado Hockey Team</a>.  Sort of like if Newton wanted to host a Team Triathlon Relay competition among the One Boulder occupants…  Still, Team Newton fought their hearts out and gave them a much, much tougher game than they obviously expected as they crushed the other competition and you could hear them chirping at the refs to the very end…  SATISFACTION!!!!</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> It was an exciting, fun night for everyone and we can all certainly be proud of the way Team Newton represented us! Thank you to all who participated making it a most memorable night in Newton lore!</span></p>

<p>I worked the 3-11 shift as a reservation sales agent for Northwest Airlines, so every day before work I ran a 1.1 mile loop by my house.  It took me 11-12 minutes.  I ran my first 5K in 36:00.  My first triathlon was in the summer of 1990, a Danskin sponsored sprint.  I loved it.  I was miserable at my job and wanted to do something involving fitness and my new healthy lifestyle.  I went back to school for three years and received my M.A. in exercise physiology from Adelphi University in New York.  That 1.1 mile run became 2, and then 4, 6, 13, and finally my first marathon, New York City 1996.  I continued in triathlon as well, competing in St.Croix in 1995 and Ironman Canada in 1998.  I had the best jobs in corporate fitness, running wellness centers for JP Morgan Chase and Philip Morris (yes, the cigarette company).  I grew tired of the toxic lifestyle in New York City and made a move to Scottsdale Arizona, just 12 days prior to 9/11.</p>
<p>We left Arizona almost 4 years to the day that we arrived, moving back East in order for my husband John to take a sales position with his company, PING Golf.  Determined to do something different, I took a part-time position at a local running store.  It kept me busy, but more importantly gave me an opportunity to meet people in the running community.  I started getting involved again in coaching individuals and large groups for 5K, as beginning runners were always special to me.  I also attended school again, and earned another degree and a license in massage therapy.  Seven years there… Following a three hour bike ride in June, I gave notice.  I didn’t know what I was going to do, but I couldn’t stay there anymore.  I had to clear something out of my life, to let something in.</p>
<p>I tried Newton running shoes for the first time in July 2008 at Ironman Lake Placid.  John bought a pair of <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-motion-v-b"">Motions</a> from Tom Curran!  I put them back on when we started to carry them at Charm City Run, but I was happy enough in whatever I was running in, so I didn’t switch.  Finally in the early part of 2011, my training partner wanted out of his Brooks Beasts and was on me constantly about Newton’s and Natural Running.  If I was to help him, I needed to know more about them so I started to run in the Gravity.  With a week left at my job at Charm City, another employee advised me of the Mid-Atlantic Tech Rep opening.  My strong exercise physiology background and my retail experience was a perfect combination, and Tom hired me in the parking lot of our Fleet Feet Baltimore store.</p>
<p>I have always been a positive, ebullient, and energetic person by nature, and was often told by my father to “cheer down” as a child.  I love what I do, I believe in what I do, and I give my best every day.  Since running in Newton shoes I have been injury free, able to run more mileage, and I’m running faster.  At 46 years of age I have run a PR at 5K, 10K, 8 Miles, 10 Miles and Half Marathon distances.  This year I plan to PR at DC Rock and Roll Marathon, finish the Northface 50 Miler and add two more Ironman events to my resume with Canada and Arizona.</p>

<p>APRIL 9, 2012 (Boulder, Co)— Newton Running, the leader in natural form running, was awarded the 2012 Glen and Mildred Robbins Leet Humanitarian Award from Trickle Up, a New York-based, non-governmental organization dedicated to alleviating poverty. Since 2008, Newton Running has made financial contributions to Trickle Up, which provides conditional seed capital and business training to the world’s lowest-earning people so that they may start a micro-enterprise.</p>
<p>“We believe strongly in what they do to help the impoverished become financially independent and give women and their children a chance at a better life,” says <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> CEO Jerry Lee.</p>
<p>Trickle Up’s mission resonates personally with Lee, a self-made entrepreneur who grew up in a low-income Illinois household with 14 brothers and sisters, then moved to Boulder, Colorado, to become a highly successful real estate investor and later co-founded Newton Running with Danny Abshire in 2007.</p>
<p>Lee accepted the award on behalf of Newton Running at the annual <a href=""http://www.trickleup.org"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.trickleup.org', 'Trickle Up');"">Trickle Up</a> gala in New York City on April 4. The Glen and Mildred Robbins Leet Humanitarian Award, named after the Trickle Up’s founders, is given to supporters who demonstrate a passionate commitment to the organization’s core mission of eradicating extreme poverty. Past award recipients include Wendy Gordon Rockefeller (2010), a leader in the green consumer movement, and Charles Slaughter, founder of TravelSmith and Living Goods (2009).</p>
<p>Newton Running’s  Director of Social Responsibility (and Jerry’s daughter), Wendy Lee, witnessed first hand the impact of Trickle Up’s investment in small businesses when she and her mother, Donna Lee, visited several war-affected Guatemalan communities in 2009. There, they met people who had opened weaving businesses and bakeries thanks to Trickle Up’s local lending programs.</p>

<p><em>Not surprisingly, when I tell people that I am an opera singer, voice teacher, triathlete, and runner, they look at me like as if I am an alien…  “Wow, I thought you’d be a little less, uh, FIT!..” hahah!  Singing is definitely an athletic activity, and I really believe that my knowledge of proper breathing techniques helps my running tremendously.  </em></p>
<p><em>In the past six months of running in <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> shoes, the Natural Running technique has been a process that I have really enjoyed studying and implementing.   I am one of those success stories that are coming out about amateur runners moving to a zero or minimal drop shoe after experiencing extreme muscle and soft tissue pain in shoes with much greater drop from heel to forefoot (14mm drop in my shoes during training for my first marathon last November..it was AGONY!).  As I continue to get stronger, more efficient, and faster (and running without soreness or pain),  I am finding that proper breath is just as crucial as  the forward lean, landing on the lugs or flat footed, letting the heel settle, and lifting the legs from the core all at 180 strides per minute. You can have the most efficient and perfect footstrike in the world, but if your shoulders are up around your ears or if you are flexing your abdominals around your ribcage during inhalation or exhalation, you are going to be susceptible to a whole host of issues while running, especially with any speed or distance.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>How does breathing in an efficient and relaxed way assist us in training and in racing? </em></strong><em> The freer and more relaxed the breath is, the more efficiently you are going to be able to oxygenate the blood, and you will be able to take in more breath without wasting energy while running.  </em></p>
<p><em>Many will say, “But, Natural Running calls me to engage my core…like this (flexes abdomen revealing a stunning six pack of abs).”  Well, guess what?  Yes, we must engage the core, but we have to know WHICH muscles support the body and those which help us move more air in and out effectively.  The core of your body according to yoga and eastern religion is a few inches below your navel and 2-3 inches inward.  This means that we are to engage the lower abdominal muscles to hold ourselves upright not by flexing the abs!  It is definitely possible to engage the lower abs or core while relaxing the rest.  It is the same with classical singing and being able to make sounds without the need for amplification. The power comes from engaging the LOWER abdominals and compressing the air on exhalation.  Just as in regular life, when you speak, you don’t need to take much breath to make sound—when singing opera, the singer must inhale and exhale more air than “normal” humans take in.  Along the same lines, when we run we must take in and exhale much more air than when we walk. There is a lot of power in the breath.  </em></p>
<p><strong><em>So let’s break down what happens when we breathe. </em></strong><em> Just for reference sake, the diaphragm is a dome shaped muscle that at rest is below the ribcage and the lungs.  On proper inhalation, the lungs fill completely as a result of relaxed abdominal muscles (including the diaphragm).  In classical and in proper technical singing, this movement of air is punctuated by an engaging or expanding of the lower abdominal muscles to keep the abdomen and ribcage from collapsing during exhalation.  The only difference between classical singing breath and proper breath during running is the AMOUNT of engagement and lean out of the lower abs and the velocity of air that is exhaled (the air during singing is much more compressed, and the muscles of the abdomen don’t move as quickly back to their original position with empty lungs.  While running, airflow should be constant, and the diaphragm should be constantly moving).  </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Okay, so now we know what happens when we breathe properly.  Let’s explore some exercises.  </em></strong></p>
<p><em>One of the best ways to try this type of relaxed/easy breathing is by lying on your back and just breathing deeply through relaxed throat muscles as if you are yawning.  If you focus on relaxing the abdominals during the breath, you will see the diaphragm and the abdomen rise and fall, and your shoulders will not rise up and become tense.  Try to fill your lungs completely. Exhale completely. Notice the movement of the abdominals. I would also suggest that you try to inhale and exhale through BOTH your mouth and nose.</em></p>
<p><em>Inhale over 4 counts of approximately a cadence of 180 beats per minute, hold for 4 counts, then exhale over 4 counts.  Really move that air with the diaphragm, especially on the exhalation.</em></p>
<p><em> <strong>To incorporate into your Natural Running form:</strong> Breathe in through your nose and mouth.   Expand the abdomen during the inhalation and do not flex.  Your lungs have reached capacity.  Now exhale, and at the same time try to pull the diaphragm and move the expanded musculature up and inward until the next breath is necessary (air often just falls in at the end of an exhalation as long as your abdominals are relaxed!!).  With the lower abdomen below the navel engaged or expanded but with the rest of the abs released you are going to feel extremely fat while implementing this technique.  This is inevitable and OKAY!  Vanity must go out the window!  You may not look as killer in that new racerback halter top or shirtless (for the guys out there) but you sure are going to be using the air more efficiently.  Forget about how you look; focus on how you breathe.  The low engagement of the “core” keeps the pelvis level from front to back, which is hugely important, but flexing the abs does nothing but waste valuable energy.</em></p>
<p><em>Running cadence should be 180 strides a minute (again, if you are running in the 5:00’s or 12:00’s it’s the same), so, 4 strides breathe in, 4 strides breathe out is ideal for the breath.  If you can inhale more that is wonderful–just make sure that the inhalation is the same duration as the exhalation (same is true for speedwork/racing—you may only get 2 strides in and two out).  </em></p>
<p><em>As is true of natural running technique, it will take some coordination and adjustment to master this kind of breath because along the same lines as heel striking goes against how we were born to run, tight abdominals and constricted breath have become the norm how we breathe because we mostly use our abs to hold ourselves upright.  </em></p>
<p><em>Add this focus on the breath to your Natural Running practice and implementation on the road or trail, and you will notice a significant change.  I sing better because of my running, and you can bet that I run better because of my singing!!!! <strong>#HelloBetter!</strong></em></p>

				<p>Today Newton is very excited to be launching our School of Running (SOR) here in Boulder, Colorado. The mission of the SOR is to spread the knowledge of good, natural running form around the world by educating those who are interested in teaching others to become better runners and who wish to become better and more efficient runners themselves.</p>
<p>The first session of SOR which began today is educating a handful of North American retail ambassadors. Soon the School of Running will expand to include Newton’s recently revamped Coach Certification Program. Details of that program will be coming soon but for now the dates of the first sessions are below.</p>

				<p>When you lose 100lbs it’s pretty easy to guess the number one question you get asked. It’s always, “So how’d you do it?” Here’s how (Part 1).</p>
<p><strong> #1 Start Small</strong></p>
<p>As I said, I failed at every diet known to man, from Atkins and Weight Watchers to the all fruit and veggies diet, so I was determined to make this time different. Instead of jumping into a plan cold turkey I would break it up into more manageable parts. I decided to just focus on fitness and not worry about food just yet. My goal was to make fitness a part of my life, something that was second nature to me. Once I was able to stay active on a regular basis, then I would focus on eating properly. I also did not try to do too much when I initially got on the treadmill. My running buddy Bryce gave me a parameter of spending a minimum of 60 minutes on the treadmill. So I made that my goal, no matter how slow I had to walk to make it happen. I think I started out walking about 2mph the first few times we went and I was exhausted when I was done.</p>
<div id=""attachment_3607"" style=""max-width: 650px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/workout.jpg""><img class=""size-large wp-image-3607"" title=""workout"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/workout-1024x764.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""477"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/workout-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/workout-300x224.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px""></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">This photo was taken at Planet Fitness in Newport News, VA. It’s blurry because I was on a treadmill at the time. I think it is the only photo taken of me actually working out while I was losing the 100lbs.</p></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#2 Challenge Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Even though I couldn’t do much in the beginning, I still wanted to be challenged. Bryce would encourage me to up the speed of the treadmill by .2 or .3mph for the last minute or two of my workout. Most of the time, I followed his suggestion, although I can’t say I didn’t complain about it a time or two! ☺ A lot of times I would work out alone but I would always make sure that I pushed myself just a little. I knew Bryce was going to ask how it went and I didn’t want him to think I was slacking off (accountability is a great motivator!). I kept track of the time, distance, and calories burned for each of my workouts and I would aim to do just a little better each time, assuming my body felt up to it. If I was overly tired or sore I would not push it because I did not want to risk an injury. Injuries are the worst and they should be avoided like the plague (more on that in a few weeks)!</p>
<p><strong> #3 Follow Through</strong></p>
<p>The biggest failure I made in every diet I tried was that I did not give it enough time to work. I would give it a few weeks and if I didn’t see the results I thought I should see I gave up. I decided this time that I was going to continue this no matter what. It was actually pretty easy to do since my goal here was not to lose weight but to make fitness a part of my life. I kept going to the gym; I kept working out. I am a normal person. I work 40+ hours a week and I have a wife and two kids. I’m not wealthy, so I can’t afford a chef or maid. I make time several days a week for me to get my work out in. Yes, that means that sometimes I have to get up at 4am in the morning to get my run in (that’s rare, but I’ve done it). It’s about doing what you know is important. This is important to me, and to my wife and kids, so I made sure that I followed through and stuck with it long enough to actually see results.</p>
<p>One early spring day, the weather seemed to be pretty nice. The longest I had run without stopping was 3 miles, but those were mostly run on a treadmill (which is easier). That day I ran a PR (personal best) 4 miles. It wasn’t pretty and it certainly wasn’t very fast (10:50 pace), but that day I fell in love with running (and haven’t stepped on a treadmill since). Running became a part of who I am. From this point on I would have a new identity…I was a runner. I felt like a superhero. I felt like I could take on the world.</p>
<p>Today, I run all the time, several times a week. When I don’t run for several days, for whatever reason, I miss it and I feel like my Newtons are giving me the evil eye every time I walk by. In fact, I am currently training for my first half marathon on November 3rd and my first full marathon next year on March 17th! Since I began, I’ve logged 583 miles over 200 workouts. I never thought I would call myself a runner. I never thought I would say that I loved running, but I do. I know there are people out there right now who are saying the same thing, that there is no way they would ever be able to run. And yet here I am. I was that guy and now I am a runner. Believe it when I say, if I (a food addict who weighed over 300lbs) can do it…you can do it!</p>

				<p>When 60 Days of Better began we had planned to have your inspirational stories here and there in our line up. However, we’ve gotten so many stories from those of you who’s lives have been changed that we’ve decided to make them an almost daily occurrence! This email is from Nelson.</p>
<p><em>I had IT band problems for 3 months and i couldn’t run at all, not even a mile. I was rehabbing it all the time: IT rolling, stretching and getting a weekly massage. After 3 months I thought i was better after a PT visit. I tried to run but couldn’t run more than 10 min without pain only 2 months before my Ragnar team. I figured if i ever try a minimal/natural running shoe with the adjoining gait this would be the time so I bought one. My first run in the minimal shoe I went the full lap around the lake, 3 miles, pain free. I tried the traditional shoes and mu knee hurt again, even with an attempted forefoot strike, but put he minimal shoes on the following day and got another lap pain-free. I have been pain free in the IT Band area, even though the slight swelling has not dissipated much, during my runs ever since.</em></p>
<p><em>My next pair will be a Newton Distance shoe.</em></p>
<p><em>Cheers!</em></p>

<p>I’m a proud Newton Elite Athlete. I’m a distance runner and 2004 Athens Olympian in the 1500 meter event. I was born in Barcelona, Spain and compete internationally for Equatorial Guinea, where my mother was born. Over the past few months I have started to transition towards the longer distances and road races, with the goal of running my first marathon sometime in the fall of 2011.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri,Verdana,Helvetica,Arial;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt;""><strong>Winning the 2010 Colorado State Cross Country Championship</strong></span></span></p>
<p>This past fall, I raced distances from 5K to half marathon on surfaces ranging from roads to trails, including one very icy road race in Canada, aptly named, “Canada’s Toughest 10K” (which due to weather conditions was changed to 6.5K on the day). On December 11, I had the pleasure of competing in and winning my 3rd Colorado State Cross Country 12K Championship in nearby Aurora, Colorado.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri,Verdana,Helvetica,Arial;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The event was put on by the Road Runners Club of America and featured distances of 4 kilometer, 8 kilometer and 12 kilometer (the championship distance). The course was snow free for the first time in the three years I’ve been running it, but challenging none-the-less.  The multiple 4-kilometer loops featured sand, single-track trail, several stream crossings as well as well groomed soccer fields.<br>
</span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri,Verdana,Helvetica,Arial;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt;""><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/RobMandje2.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-2285"" title=""RobMandje2"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/RobMandje2-198x300.jpg"" alt=""RobMandje2"" width=""198"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/RobMandje2-198x300.jpg 198w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/RobMandje2.jpg 529w"" sizes=""(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px""></a>The starter’s gun went off a little bit after 10 a.m. with about 60 hearty cross-country fanatics rushing towards the bottleneck trailhead some 150 meters ahead, where I found myself comfortably in 3rd place.</span></span></p>
<p>The first “cross-country mile,” as race director Rob Fisher humorously described in the moments before the race started, was reached in 6 minutes! I knew then, that this race was probably going to be a lot longer than previously advertised.  I negotiated the first  stream crossing by jumping the entire gap and claimed the lead shortly before the mile mark.</p>
<p>I reached “two miles” (cross country miles of course) in 12 minutes and 32 seconds, and knew without a doubt that all hopes of a respectable time would be out the window. At that moment I just focused on staying relaxed and protecting my lead through the first of three laps.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;"">I was fortunate this year to run away with the victory by well over 2 minutes. My final time was 47:28, with very little doubt that I covered WELL over 12 kilometers.  In year’s past I’ve battled with past Colorado University All-Americans and/or local Boulder-based elite runners belonging to different clubs. I was very cold and exhausted by the race’s end, and only then did I realize that extent of my lead. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;"">It was a great way to cap off my foray into the longer distances this past fall, and I’m eagerly looking forward to 2011, as I’ll look to make my marathon debut. Now I’m on a brief break from racing, and just training through the winter months in my trusted <a title=""Newton Running"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/newton-products/the-shoes/mens-shoes/men-guidance-trainer/neutral-guidance-trainer"" target=""_blank"">Sir Isaac</a>’s for a fast half marathon in early 2011.</span></p>

<p><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/PF.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-2598"" title=""plantar fasciitis"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/PF-271x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""271"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/PF-271x300.jpg 271w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/PF.jpg 550w"" sizes=""(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px""></a>The plantar fascia (PF) is a strong ligament that runs from the heel to the metatarsal heads in the front of your foot. This ligament helps absorb the shock that occurs when your foot contacts the ground. It has function in the windlass mechanism recreating the arch on takeoff.</p>
<p>Plantar fasciitis is the common term for what should be more accurately termed Plantar Fasciosis. <strong><em>itits</em></strong> is an acute inflammation caused by a trauma or infection. <strong><em>osis</em></strong> is chronic degenerative condition.</p>
<p>No evidence exists for an ideal treatment of this condition without identifying and treating the causes, which can be many. Since we have no literature to guide us, I offer this advice based on my experience treating hundreds of runners and guiding them in self corrections.</p>
<p><strong>What Causes Plantar Fasciitis?</strong></p>
<p>The PF is designed to manage a relatively small amount of stress. The intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the foot are designed to receive signals from the fascia and in turn manage the majority of the load. When those muscles are dysfunctional, the load is transferred to the PF, which is unable to handle it, and results in tearing.</p>
<p>You can repair these tears by using palliative methods, but PF may return as soon as you resume running. <strong>The only way that you can actually fix plantar fasciitis is to address the root cause: weak foot muscles.</strong> (Thank you Lance from Barefoot Science for the insight).</p>
<p>Several structural causes can contribute to PF:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weak intrinsic foot muscles</li>
<li>A misaligned and weak first toe</li>
<li>Tight, shortened calf muscles</li>
<li>Tight plantar fascia</li>
</ul>
<p>Other important contributing factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased mechanical stress from running or other activity</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Suddenly switching from supportive footwear that inhibit intrinsic foot muscles to flat shoes (flip flops) or barefoot</li>
<li>Poor walking and running mechanics</li>
<li>Wearing overly supportive footwear weaken the foot and make it less stable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Do You Correct Plantar Fasciitis?<br>
<span id=""more-2590""></span></h3>
<p>Try a combination of these treatment principles (which is most effective will  depend on the cause):</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an orthotic, arch support or taping should be a <em>temporary</em> mode of relief while you strengthen and lengthen the tissues. Applying a support device over a long period of time is akin to wearing a cast on a broken arm forever (resulting in muscles atrophy from disuse).</li>
<li>HTP <a href=""http://www.heel-that-pain.com/pain_relief.php"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.heel-that-pain.com/pain_relief.php', 'heel seat');"" target=""_blank"">heel seat</a> is a useful, non-supportive tool for short-term relief while you strengthen the foot.</li>
<li>Perform eccentric heel dips from a stair. Place your foot on stair and drop your heels down. It is OK to have a little pain doing this as long as it progressively improves.</li>
<li>Dorsiflex the big toe to lengthen a tight plantar fascia.</li>
<li>Gradually stop wearing any type of shoe with a heel during <em>ALL</em> activities.</li>
<li>Work on foot intrinsics, such as picking things up with your toes and walking barefoot. For more foot exercise ideas, see this video at <a href=""http://www.heel-that-pain.com/plantar_fasciitis/exercise/plantar_fasciitis_exercise.php"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.heel-that-pain.com/plantar_fasciitis/exercise/plantar_fasciitis_exercise.php', 'Heel That Pain');"" title=""Heel That Pain"" target=""_blank"">Heel That Pain</a>.</li>
<li>Practice natural running technique that involves making light ground contact, reduced loading rate, and more proprioceptive cueing.

<li>Throughout the day, strengthen your big toe by pushing it into the ground as often as you can whenever you are standing. This will wake up the foot muscles and help recreate the arch.</li>
<li>If you first toe curves inward, consider a straightening product like <a href=""http://www.toesalad.com/articles/plantar-fasciitis"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.toesalad.com/articles/plantar-fasciitis', 'Correct toes');"">Correct toes</a> by Dr. Ray McClanahan.</li>
<li>Use the principle of gradual progression and body sensing when making any changes.</li>
<li>Avoid NSAIDS (Motrin, Ibuprofen, etc). These drugs interfere with natural healthy healing processes.</li>
<li>See a good health provider who understands natural running and walking.</li>
<li>Wear minimalist footwear!</li>

In this case, M.D. of Vancouver, British Columbia, found relief from Morton’s Neuroma with Newton Running shoes. Here’s her story:</p>
<p>“Yesterday while shopping for a new pair of running shoes for my husband, a very cute shoe caught my eye, it was the Newton Terra Momentus. (Newton Running no longer carries the Terra Momentus, but the <a title=""Newton Running Store"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/lady-isaac-s-16"" target=""_blank"">Lady Isaac S </a>is a great alternative!) I asked to try them on and fell in love at first wearing. I have been struggling with Morton’s Neuroma in my right foot for over a year and had reached the point of accepting that I would just have to get used to the pain.</p>
<p>As soon as I tried on the shoe, I realized that the point of contact was at the mid foot, thereby avoiding the metatarsal and the neuroma. I got excited. I took a quick jog outside and got more excited and bought the shoes</p>
<p>I couldn’t wait to get to the gym this morning to give them a real test drive. Sure enough, I could do all the high impact moves that I wasn’t able to do before. The only thing that held me back was my own fitness level rather than the neuroma!”</p>
<p>–M.D.</p>
<p>Individuals that suffer from Morton’s Neuroma have different demands that need to be met. That being said, we can’t recommend a particular model to everyone, but we can say that we’ve had several success stories from people trying out the <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/lady-isaac-s-16"">Lady Isaac S</a>, <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/womens-kismet-ii-charcoal"">Women’s Kismet II</a>, <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-sir-isaac-s-16"">Sir Isaac S</a> and the <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-kismet-ii-white"">Men’s Kismet II</a>.</p>

<p><em>By Danny Abshire, co-founder, <a title=""Newton Running"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"" target=""_blank"">Newton Running</a></em></p>
<p>Whatever your body type, fitness level or experience, the two biggest changes you can make to improve your running performance and reduce the likelihood of overuse injury are:</p>
<p>1. Wear shoes with a nearly level profile<br>
2. Learn how to run naturally</p>
<p><strong>How an Elevated Heel Affects Running Form</strong></p>
<p>For the past 30 years, running shoes have been designed with thickly cushioned, built-up heels. This type of shoe forces the body to balance itself in an unnatural, backward-leaning position. Your toes are pointing downward, your weight is shifted rearward, and your back is slightly arched. Basically, your body struggles to maintain balance while compensating for the lifted heel.</p>
<p>If you’ve been running this way for years — and most people have — it’s likely the muscles and other soft tissue in your feet, lower legs (the Achilles tendons in particular) and core need to adapt to the proper body position that comes with running in flat shoes.</p>
<p>The Achilles tendon acts like a large rubber band that stretches and recoils with every stride. If you’ve been wearing shoes with an elevated heel — including your everyday work and casual shoes — your Achilles tendon has a shorter range of motion. When you begin running in a level shoe, like a Newton shoe, the Achilles tendon needs to stretch to accommodate for the 10-15 mm distance that used to be taken up by an elevated heel.</p>
<p><strong>How to Make the Switch</strong></p>
<p>If you abruptly transition from an elevated heel to doing all your mileage in a level shoe, you’re likely to feel some Achilles and calf muscle soreness. Instead, make the transition gradually: run less than a mile at a time a 2 or 3 days per week. Work on your form and build strength in your feet, ankles and lower legs with the following tips:</p>
<p>Work on strength and balance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go flat as often as possible! Ease the transition on your Achilles and calf muscles by walking barefoot. Wear flatter shoes even when you’re not running.</li>
<li>Do balancing drills. Stand on one foot with a mostly straight leg, lift the other foot off the ground at a 90 degree angle and close your eyes. If you can maintain balance for 30 seconds with your eyes closed on both sides, you may have enough strength be begin transitioning to level shoes. If you lose balance on either side, make this drill part of your daily regime. (Be sure to work on each foot.)</li>
<li>Do barefoot heel dips on a staircase. While holding on to a wall or railing, balance yourself with your metatarsal heads on the edge of the stair even with the ball of your foot. Slowly dip your heel below the plane of the stair, feeling the stretch in your Achilles and calf muscles and then slowly raise back up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Increase the flexibility and range of motion in your feet and lower legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do common wall stretches. Lean into a wall with your hands while flexing the lower calf with a flat foot. Do this with both a straight and bent knee and repeat a couple times per day after the muscles are sufficiently warm.</li>
<li>Increase the flexibility of your plantar fascia. While sitting in a chair, cross your leg over your knee and firmly push your fingers or a thumb into the center of the sole of your foot. Maintain that pressure and point your toes up and down to stretch the plantar fascia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on form:</p>
<ul>
<li>After a run, use form drills to further develop specific aspects of proper running form. Skipping, bounding, high knees and butt kicks are easy and don’t take a lot of time.</li>
<li>Watch yourself run. Have a friend video your stride in traditional shoes, level shoes and while running barefoot on grass. Notice how your body moves differently in each scenario.<br>
Do your feet land under your center of mass? Are you running with a quick cadence and relatively short strides? Are you running with upright but slightly forward-leaning posture? Are you carrying your arms close to your body at about a 90-degree angle? Adopt this form in your new shoes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take it easy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Your inner marathoner might be craving the challenge and rejuvenation that a long run always brings, but refrain from going on long runs until you’ve gone through a gradual progression. Increase your weekly mileage by no more than 10 percent per week and make sure you’re diligent about self-analyzing your form and your progression.</li>
</ul>

<p>The answer is yes, we’ve seen <a href=""http://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/', 'Dr. Lieberman’s studies at Harvard');"" title=""Harvard Study"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Lieberman’s studies at Harvard</a> and it clearly validates what <a href=""http://www.NewtonRunning.com"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.NewtonRunning.com', 'Newton Running');"" title=""Newton Running"" target=""_blank"">Newton Running</a> is all about.</p>
<p>Please read the open letter below from Newton Running co-founder Danny Abshire and our Director of Education, Ian Adamson.</p>
<p><strong> Our Take on Barefoot Running<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Many of you have seen or heard the numerous national news stories about barefoot running in the past few days. This news comes on the heels of the recently published study, <em>Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners</em> by Harvard University anthropologist Dan Lieberman.</p>
<p>Dr. Lieberman and colleagues concluded that modern, cushioned running shoes change the way humans run and hypothesize based on their biomechanical findings that forefoot and some midfoot strikes may make runners less prone to some kinds of injury. (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jrnj-7YKZE"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jrnj-7YKZE', 'He explains his hypothesis in this video');"" title=""YouTube Video"" target=""_blank"">He explains his hypothesis in this video</a>).</p>
<p>That comes as no surprise to us at Newton Running. Our company was founded on the belief that the lifted heel in modern running shoes promotes improper form and can contribute to various injuries. Our shoes are <a title=""Improve Your Running"" href=""http://http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/improve-your-running"" target=""_blank"">designed specifically to accommodate and enhance natural running</a> foot-strike and gait and are based on decades of research and observation on shoe technology and running mechanics.</p>
<p>Running barefoot is not a viable option for most people, except for short training sessions on forgiving surfaces. Plus, the transition to barefoot running or ultra-minimalist shoes can be difficult and/or painful for runners who have spent their whole lives running in heavily cushioned and overly structured shoes.</p>
<p>Newton Running shoes <a title=""Shoe Technology"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/newton-running-videos/shoe-technology"" target=""_blank"">feature a geometry and design</a> that facilitates your natural gait and protects you from harsh running surfaces. We offer the only viable alternative to both modern running shoes and barefoot/ultra-minimalist shoe running.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> Shoe Design</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1. Typical running shoes feature a thick, padded heel and a steep heel-to-forefoot ramp angle (gradient), which encourages heavy heel striking, increases shock loads and dampens afferent feedback (the ability to sense the surface under your shoes). Newton Running shoes have a negligible gradient (between 1% and 3%), which allows your foot to land with a reduced impact and take advantage of your body’s natural suspension system.

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2. Newton Running shoes provide industry-leading impact force reduction and energy return with our proprietary <a title=""Action/Reaction Technology"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/technology/"" target=""_blank"">Action/Reaction Technology™</a> strategically placed on the sweet spot under your forefoot.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;""><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/sweetspot.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1364 aligncenter"" title=""sweetspot"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/sweetspot.jpg"" alt=""sweetspot"" width=""232"" height=""109"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sweetspot.jpg 460w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sweetspot-300x140.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px""></a></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3. <a title=""Newton Running shoes"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/newton-products/the-shoes"" target=""_blank"">Newton Running shoes</a> are built with a biomechanical plate positioned directly under your metatarsals to enhance afferent feedback and allow your feet to spread naturally under load. The soft foam in regular running shoes dampens and blocks valuable protective feedback at foot strike. Without feeling the ground, runners will impact and push harder, creating the possibility for injury.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4. The anatomically designed upper and midsole allows your foot to move naturally throughout the gait cycle. In contrast, most modern running shoes are highly structured, rigidly encasing your foot and preventing natural movement. Over time, this weakens the foot and creates overuse of propulsive muscles/tendons, increasing the likelihood of <a title=""Preventing Injuries"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/newton-running-videos/injury-prevention/177-prevent-running-injuries"" target=""_blank"">running injuries</a>.</p>
<p>Coaches around the world routinely use barefoot drills to improve running form. Newton Running has created the first natural running shoes for everyday training and racing that encourage barefoot running form.

From the bestselling book <a href=""http://www.chrismcdougall.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chrismcdougall.com/', 'Born To Run,');"" title=""Born to Run Book"" target=""_blank""><em>Born To Run</em>,</a> to the explosive growth of the Vibram Five Fingers, runners everywhere seem to be talking about barefoot running.</p>
<p>Well, the buzz about barefoot running is about to hit a fever pitch. As we’ve talked about in previous posts, Harvard anthropologist Dan Lieberman has been studying the evolution of human running for several years. Dr. Lieberman has just published the results of his study in the journal <em>Nature </em>and the mainstream media is running (cough) with the story.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Vibram Five Fingers are also getting a lot of attention from the media (Vibram sponsored Lieberman’s study). The Five Fingers clearly help people to try barefoot running, while providing some protection from rocks, glass, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How do Newton Running shoes compare to Vibram Five Fingers</strong></p>
<p>Newton’s are built for <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123031997"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123031997', 'Natural Running');"" target=""_blank"">Natural Running</a> but some of you may be wondering how Newtons compare to Vibrams. Amanda Brooks asked just that on her blog, <a href=""http://runtothefinish.blogspot.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://runtothefinish.blogspot.com/', 'Run to the Finish');"" target=""_blank"">Run to the Finish</a>, and Newton Running’s Director of Education and Research, Ian Adamson, had this response:</p>
<p><span style=""color: #333399;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">“Running Newton Shoes and Vibram Five Fingers have many similarities, at least from a form perspective. The primary difference is the cushioning and energy return provided by Newtons, which is largely absent in Vibrams.</span><br>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Barefoot running forces you to run efficiently and preventatively with respect to injury. Vibram’s allow people to experience barefoot running with an added layer of protection from harsh surfaces, while Newton’s go one step further, adding forefoot cushioning and  a significant energy return component.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Newton shoes are much kinder to the body’s structure and musculature when transitioning from a traditional running shoe to barefoot, and allow you to perfect a natural (barefoot) form while providing protection and cushioning.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Newton’s <span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a style=""color: #0000ff;"" title=""Action/Reaction Technology"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/technology/"" target=""_blank"">Action/Reaction Technology</a></span> has been carefully designed to facilitate afferent feedback, which means the nerves in your forefoot feel the ground very quickly through the shoe. This is achieved through the outer lugs and internal semi-rigid chamber that is connected to the biomechanical top plate adjacent to your foot inside the shoe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Traditional shoe cushioning mechanisms dampens afferent feedback, hampering proprioception and thus hindering your ability to self-regulate the impact of your foot strike. Studies show that runners strike much harder in cushioned shoes, one of the causes of injury. Running barefoot or in shoes that allow you to sense the ground encourage you to run protectively.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Bottom line is; both Vibrams and Newtons encourage a barefoot or natural running style, but Newtons make it easier for most runners to transition their form after years of wearing traditional’ running shoes. </span></p>

It is now available to <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/natural-running-book"">order online</a>.</p>
<p>“This is the single most important resource for people who want to enjoy running as nature intended while protecting themselves from unnatural surfaces,” says Abshire. “The book will teach you to run the barefoot way—with shoes—and become a more efficient, stronger and healthier runner.”</p>
<p>Danny is a passionate, lifelong runner who has spent 10 years designing and refining Newton Running shoes. As a longtime running form coach and injury expert, he has worked closely with thousands of athletes, from beginners to Olympic elites, helping them improve their running form and technique.</p>
<p>“Danny has worked with some of the best runners and triathletes in the history of endurance sports,” says Craig Alexander, two-time Ironman World Champion. “Just speaking to him will make you a better runner.”</p>
<p>In <em>Natural Running</em>, Abshire explains the posture, arm carriage, cadence, and land-lever-lift foot positioning that mimic the barefoot running style. Runners transition from heel striking to a midfoot or forefoot strike, which studies show is how the body evolved to run. So that runners can relearn this more natural running gait, Abshire offers an 8-week transition plan, complete with a tool kit of strength and form drills that build and maintain the musculature required for natural running.</p>

				<p><em>by Danny Abshire, co-founder, Newton Running<a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/barefoot-running.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-2798"" title=""barefoot running"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/barefoot-running.jpg"" alt="""" width=""169"" height=""162""></a></em></p>
<p>People have been experimenting with barefoot running for a long time, but in recent years the activity has gained mainstream notoriety and science-based credibility.</p>
<p>Most coaches, elite athletes, physiologists and other medical experts agree that running barefoot in very small doses on soft surfaces can help improve your running mechanics and teach your body to land lightly at your midfoot, but they also agree that you should wear some kind of running shoes most of the time.</p>
<p>“Throw your shoes away for good? Sure, if you have perfect mechanics and you’ve been living barefoot all of your life,” says Dr. Mark Cucuzzella, a West Virginia University professor and 2:25 marathoner who has studied barefoot and minimalist runners in relation to running injuries. “But that’s not the majority of runners. Most runners absolutely need to wear shoes when they run.”</p>
<p><strong>What Shoe Type is Best?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re used to running in a traditional training shoe with a built-up heel, running barefoot can be a fascinating experience of freedom and can be the first step in developing natural running mechanics. Running unshod your foot naturally seeks out the ground by landing at the midfoot/forefoot, where it receives sensory interaction, or afferent feedback.</p>
<p>This sensory input immediately tells the rest of the body how to move efficiently with light footsteps, a high leg cadence, a relaxed but consistent arm swing, an upright posture and a slight forward lean from the ankles. This same feedback can be gained while wearing some types of lightweight shoes, but traditional trainers with thick levels of foam dampen the sensory interaction and make it much harder to interpret the ground, especially with the heel-striking gait those shoes promote.</p>
<p><strong>How Run “Barefoot” in Shoes</strong></p>
<p>Landing lightly at your midfoot and picking up your foot quickly to start a new stride is the most effective way your body knows to propel and protect itself while running. Conversely, your body generally doesn’t allow you to land on your heel if you’re running barefoot (especially on a hard surface) because it isn’t engineered to accommodate the blunt force trauma of repeated heel striking.</p>
<p>True, the calcaneus (heel) bone is a large bone, but it was designed to take the lower impacts of a walking gait and help balance the body as it rolls forward, as well as to help support and balance the body in a standing position as the rear point of a tripod.</p>
<p>Accepting large impacts on the heel bone from heel-strike running on the roads barefoot sends tremendous shockwaves (or impact transients) up your body. Those impact transients can have numerous negative affects upstream as your body tries to offset that force and remain balanced, including various forms of tendinitis, illiotibial band strains and adverse sheering in the pelvis and lower spine.</p>
<p>“It’s no different than somebody hitting you on the heel with a sledgehammer with 300 to 400 pounds of force,” says Dr. Daniel Lieberman, the Harvard University evolutionary biologist who concluded in a study released in January 2010 that running with midfoot footstrikes, either barefoot or in shoes, is better and less impactful than <a title=""Optimal Running Form"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/optimal-running-form"">heel-striking</a>. “So if you’re going to do that, it makes sense to wear shoes. A shoe makes that comfortable. A shoe essentially slows that rate of loading enormously — by about sevenfold in a typical shoe — and that’s what makes it comfortable and that’s why a lot of people can wear shoes and heel-strike.”</p>
<p><span id=""more-1807""></span><strong>Is Running Without Shoes Bad?</strong></p>
<p>Many proponents of barefoot running point to Ethiopia’s Abebe Bikila as the patron saint of barefoot runners. But even though he won the 1960 Olympic marathon through the streets of Rome, there’s much more to the story. Having run barefoot for much of his life, it wasn’t a huge leap for Bikila to consider running without shoes. What most people forget is he continued to run — and win — marathons while wearing running shoes, including the 1964 Olympic marathon in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Even though Lieberman’s study concluded that barefoot running with a midfoot stance was more efficient and less impactful than running with a heel-striking stance in shoes, he doesn’t mean you should run your next big city marathon barefoot. Nor should you train regularly without shoes or run on the roads without shoes, at least according to most doctors, podiatrists, physical therapists, coaches and elite runners. Running barefoot on the roads or running barefoot most of the time is just not practical or safe.</p>
<p>“I definitely feel like the risk of injury is a lot higher. People don’t know how to temper themselves and they get too excited about this new thing and trying something different without a building process,” says two-time U.S. Olympian Alan Culpepper, a 2:09 marathoner and owner of Solepepper Sports in Louisville, Colo. “I think to run exclusively barefoot or in minimalist shoes is more of a lifestyle thing and not really about performance running,” he says.</p>
<p>Some foot types cannot handle the impacts of barefoot running, such as feet with hyper-mobility, hypo-mobility or imbalances in the forefoot that need correcting by an orthotic. Also, tissue in muscle, tendon, ligament, skin and the fat pads under your feet can take a long time to adapt to hard impacts, contact with abrasive surfaces and the full range of motion that occurs when barefoot.</p>
<p><strong>Drills Help Restore Proper Foot Function</strong></p>
<p>Work boots, men’s and women’s dress shoes, cowboy boots and many other types of sneakers have elevated heels, which means most of us are accustom to a limited range of motion, dampened feedback, a layer of protection and a shortened Achilles tendon. Even small amounts of barefoot running (or walking) can leave feet sore and fatigued, but too much barefoot running can lead to injuries like plantar fasciitis, a inflamed Achilles tendon or strained calf muscles.</p>
<p>Most of America’s top professional and collegiate distance-running coaches utilize some form of barefoot running or barefoot strength and proprioception drills in small doses. Used properly these drills can improve balance, strengthen the small muscles in the feet and lower legs and maintain a runner’s form and, ultimately, individual running economy (oxygen cost at a given pace) to maximize race performance.</p>
<p>But if you’ve never done any kind of barefoot drills or running, it is important to transition into unshod exercising very slowly. Consider starting with barefoot lunges, barefoot squats or walking barefoot through sand with accentuated rolling from heel to mid-stance to toes. After a few weeks, you can start running easy acceleration strides or a few cool down laps on the soft grass infield after a long run or track workout.</p>
<p>The principle behind barefoot running makes sense, but even if you’ve got great mechanics and exceptional core strength, you should still run with shoes to keep your feet out of harm’s way and choose a lightweight, minimalist shoes with a low ramp angle to mimic the bare foot. <a title=""Newton Running Shoes"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/"">Newton Running Shoes</a>, and shoes in general will protect your feet from hazards like glass, gravel and debris, and they will provide thermal protection properties.</p>
<p>The bottom line: if you’re going to run barefoot, do it responsibly, sensibly and in small doses.</p>

				<p><strong>By Danny Abshire, co-founder, Newton Running</strong></p>
<p>No one has <a title=""Best Running Form"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/run-better/"">perfect running form</a>, but everyone can improve their running mechanics. Doing so can make you a more efficient runner, which means you’ll use less energy in every stride and boost your running economy (the ability to process oxygen efficiently while running). Ultimately, improved form can make you faster and less prone to overuse injuries. <a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2010-06-30-at-5.01.13-PM.png""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1863"" title=""Screen shot 2010-06-30 at 5.01.13 PM"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2010-06-30-at-5.01.13-PM.png"" alt=""Screen shot 2010-06-30 at 5.01.13 PM"" width=""208"" height=""190""></a></p>
<p>One of the primary ways to improve your running technique is through form drills. Form drills are easy to do and don’t take a lot of time, but they’re often overlooked, forgotten or ignored when a workout is completed. Taking an extra 5 to 15 minutes to do form drills a several times per week can make you more fluid, more efficient and even faster for both short and long distances.</p>
<p>Most drills take the aspects of good form — a compact arm swing, soft footstrikes with the midfoot under your center of mass, quick leg turnover, an upright posture with a slight forward lean at the ankles — and accentuate it in a repetitive motion that trains the body to be comfortable with that movement during your regular running mechanics. Some drills are aimed at building smaller muscles (such as the intrinsic group and lumbrical group in the foot), while others help your neuromuscular system fire quicker.</p>
<p>Do one set of each drill three to five times per week. You can do the drills before or after your regular workout, but doing them after a workout can be especially helpful in loosening muscular tightness brought on during your run.</p>
<p><strong>1) </strong><strong>Run in Place</strong></p>
<p>This sounds simple, and it is, but it requires an adherence to good form in a semi-stationary setting while varying your cadence from high to very high. If you’re following the aspects of good form, you should be moving forward slightly because your momentum and a slight lean from the ankles will carry you forward.</p>
<p>While you’re doing this drill, think about each element individually — a compact and consistent arm swing, light, mostly flat, midfoot/forefoot footstrikes, a steady but relaxed head, jaw, neck, shoulders and torso — and how each plays into the bigger picture of your running form.</p>
<p>This drill is especially effective in teaching your body to increase leg cadence (optimally to 180 steps per minute) and learning how to lift your leg to start a stride instead of pushing off. Do three 15-second sessions per set.</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong><strong>Jump Rope</strong></p>
<p>Jumping rope is simple, but as a drill it’s not going to help your running unless you’re doing it right. Jumping rope can instill the soft, midfoot/forefoot landings we aim for while running. Your body will naturally not let you land on your heel — especially if you’re jumping rope barefoot — because landing on your heels would inflict too much force on the bones, muscles and other tissue in your heels, ankles and legs.</p>
<p>It can also emphasize elastic recoil, as your heel settles on the ground before a new stride begins. Jumping rope also reinforces the notion that a new stride should begin by lifting your leg instead of pushing off. As you jump off the ground, focus on lightly lifting your feet off the ground instead of forcefully pushing off the ground.</p>
<p>Alter your tempo between slow, medium and fast speeds, all while concentrating on the tenets of <a title=""Good Running Form"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-better/optimal-running-form"">good running form</a>. Each set should be 15-20 seconds in duration.</p>
<p><strong>3) </strong><strong>High Knees</strong></p>
<p>Running in place with high knees is another drill that accentuates lifting your foot off the ground instead forcefully pushing off to begin a new stride. This is essentially jogging in place, alternately lifting your knees to a 90-degree angle with your thighs parallel to the ground.</p>
<p>As with the jog in place drill, your slight forward lean and the momentum gained in this drill will gradually move you forward. Be sure to focus on soft, run <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL223ABCDEA194D93C"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL223ABCDEA194D93C', 'midfoot and forefoot footstrikes');"" title=""Land - Lever - Lift"">midfoot and forefoot footstrikes</a>, using your core to lower your leg down slowly instead of letting it crash to the ground.</p>
<p>This drill requires and also helps instill a compact and consistent arm swing, even though your arms might cycle slightly slower to coincide with the longer hang time of your legs. The motion of your arms will actually help you lift a foot off the ground to start a new stride and keep you balanced. (Briefly try this drill with your arms stationary at your sides and you’ll find yourself forcefully pushing your feet off the ground and you’ll have a more difficult time keeping balanced.)</p>
<p>Keep your torso, head and shoulders relaxed and fairly still during this drill and avoid too much vertical oscillation with your center of mass. Each set should consist of 20 high-knee thrusts or 10 elevations of each knee.</p>
<p><strong>4) </strong><strong>Butt Kicks</strong></p>
<p>Butt Kicks accentuate the recovery portion of the running gait phase. Instead of using your hamstring to lift your leg off the ground, think about alternately flicking your lower leg backward with the use of your quadriceps and hamstring muscles then dropping it back down to the ground under the center of your mass.</p>
<p>The movement should be quick and pronounced but relaxed so that you’re able to return your foot to the ground softly at the midfoot. As with High Knees, a compact and consistent arm swing is crucial to keeping your balance and maintaining a high cadence. Each set should consist of 20 butt kick strides or 10 elevations of each leg.</p>
<p><strong>5) </strong><strong>Skipping 1 – Quick Skip</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this drill is to quicken the timing of your neuromuscular system so you can increase your running cadence to 180 steps per minute or slightly faster. As you quickly pick up one leg off the ground with the start of a stride, the other foot skips off the ground with two small and quick hops before the legs alternate.</p>
<p>There is a staccato sensation to this drill when it’s done correctly, but the more you practice it the easier you’ll fall into a consistent rhythm. A compact and very quick arm swing is crucial to keeping your balance and maintaining a high cadence. Each set should consist of about 15 to 20 seconds of skipping.</p>
<p><strong>6) </strong><strong>Skipping 2 – Slow Skip</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the previous drill, this is a slow-action skipping drill that accentuates the high knee action of the lifted leg during a running stride. With this drill, you’ll practice lifting your leg off the ground to being a new stride instead of pushing off the ground. To extend the duration of the lifted leg in the air, you’ll skip with the opposite foot.</p>
<p>The rhythm of this drill will also have a staccato effect, but it will be much slower in nature. A compact, slow arm swing will keep your balance and allow you to maintain a high cadence. Each set should consist of about 15 to 20 seconds of skipping.</p>
<p><strong>7) </strong><strong>Donkey Kicks</strong></p>
<p>It seems like a silly name, but it looks just like it sounds like. Begin with a straight, slightly forward-leaning posture, a compact arm swing, level hips and flexed ankles and knees of the athletic “ready” position. Pull one leg backwards as if you’re kicking something behind you.</p>
<p>While balancing on the midfoot area of the stationary leg, repeatedly pull the kicking leg backward, then allowing it to recoil forward. This drill accentuates good hip extension and teaches your body to make footstrikes under your center of mass. Do 10 kicks with each leg per set.</p>
<p><strong>8 ) </strong><strong>Arm Pull Backs</strong></p>
<p>This drill accentuates the proper motion of the arms during the gait cycle by highlighting the posterior portion of the compact arm swing. Begin with a level head and shoulders, keeping a straight spine with a slightly forward-leaning posture between the chin and hips. Alternate pushing your arms backwards as they are held at 90 degrees (or less).</p>
<p>The key is keeping your arms swinging in a plane parallel to your torso and not rotating your body to assist the movement. Do a total of 20 alternating pull backs per set, 10 with each side.</p>

				<p><em>The following article was written by Danny Abshire, Newton co-founder, and covers the mind-body connection necessary for natural running.<br>
</em></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dannynewton1.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-2480"" alt=""Danny(newton)"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dannynewton1-209x300.jpg"" width=""209"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dannynewton1-209x300.jpg 209w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dannynewton1.jpg 687w"" sizes=""(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px""></a>Learning to run with natural, efficient form isn’t just a physical endeavor. It is a whole body movement, coordinated by an instinctive mind-body connection. The many motions your body makes when running are choreographed and orchestrated by the brain as it continually tries to rebalance your body with gravity. <em></em></p>
<p>When running naturally, two major factors allow us to default to the healthiest, most efficient running posture. The first is maintaining a posture that is neutral or balanced with gravity. Stand up barefoot and notice if your feet and pelvis are level, and if you are lined up vertically from the head through your shoulders, hip and knee through the center of the foot.</p>
<p>Second is the sensory input derived from your feet, specifically the forefoot. The brain is a proficient computer that instantaneously responds to input from the foot by making the micro adjustments needed to keep your legs, arms, torso, shoulders and head positioned to be balanced with gravity. And thanks to the harmonious mind-body connection we have, it can all happen without us thinking about it.</p>
<p>Through gait analysis patterns and scientific studies we know that when running naturally or barefoot humans will instinctively touch the earth with a midfoot or forefoot landing, and we will touch with less impact than a heel-strike landing. When running naturally, your forefoot senses the ground the instant it touches down and starts a kinematic chain that propels your running mechanics into the most efficient and effective position for the terrain you’re on. Subconsciously, you alter your form slightly on different types of terrain and in different conditions — slippery, wet, dry, rocky, muddy, steep, flat. Why? Because your brain takes the sensory feedback from the forefoot’s interaction with the ground and positions your body accordingly.</p>
<p>Your brain helps the body make adjustments to find the proper balance with gravity, no matter what compromises it has to make. For example, something placed under a portion of the foot which puts it out of a level, balanced position will cause the whole body to react and make micro adjustments to center itself.</p>
<p>A common but detrimental example of this is running with shoes where the heel is lifted 12-15mm higher than the forefoot. The ramp angle caused by this lift (which can be found in most traditional training shoes made in the past 30 years), forces the body to make adjustments to become balanced with gravity. Knees become locked instead of the pliable spring suspension systems, hips tilt forward, the lower back arches and the upper torso tips backward. This results in more pressure put on the knees, hips and lower spine. In other words, the mind-body connection puts us in balance with gravity, but the whole body kinematics will be such that we’re trying to move efficiently from a very inefficient (heel-striking) position. Worse yet, the soft cushion of foam in the built up heel sends the incorrect message that it is safe to run with an inefficient heel-striking position.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see that this is not an optimal. Running from this position, your body must continue to compensate with all of its movements. With each stride, it’s trying to return to a compromised balanced-with-gravity position. The most common result is a heel-striking gait rather than the more efficient midfoot or forefoot footstrikes. The braking motion involved with heel striking allows your body to quickly get balanced with gravity, but it demands more muscular force to regain the momentum lost while braking at the start of each stride.</p>
<p>That’s why some runners — many whom have been running for years — will say, “I’m a natural heel striker,” or “I heel strike when I get lazy.” The truth is, it has nothing to do with being natural or lazy and has everything to do with the mind-body connection. Your body is compensating for the compromised starting position in shoes with a built-up heel, which is not sustainable for most people.</p>
<p>If you’re starting in a position in which you are balanced with gravity and your feet are flat on the ground (or in shoes with only a slight ramp angle – less than 3%), your body doesn’t have to compromise at all. With a slight forward lean from the center of your mass, you will start to fall forward. Lift your leg and place your foot level back under your body, and you’re running naturally. Meanwhile your uncompromised mind-body connection will position your head, arms, torso and hips so you can move as efficiently as possible. It’s what our body knows from the time we’re born and it’s the most efficient form of running. And it’s what allows our muscles, heart and lungs to exert the least amount of effort while running at any given pace.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">I just wanted to thank you for your contribution to the running world. I received a few injuries while serving on several overseas tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo/Bosnia, but the worst injury I sustained was being shot through my left knee with an AK-47. I have always been a strong runner, but this injury put me out for a long time. I was never able to run pain free due to the acl/mcl damage the round caused. I came across Newton Running at my 1st triathlon event this year after 1.5 years off due to the injury and rehab. I bought a pair of the Sir Isaacs and then the Distance racers. I am now running pain-free and believe these are the best engineered running shoes that exist. I have turned about 10 people on to Newton shoes now and they are as happy as I am. I am training my rear off with hopes of becoming a pro triathlete. Had I not found your shoes, I never would have even considered it. I am planning a big race season in 2011 starting with Rohto IM 70.3 Florida, IM 70.3 Muncie, and IM Louisville in hopes of qualifying for Kona. No one or anything stops me when I am determined and I want to thank you for turning my life around. Whether it be racing, training, coaching, or just knocking around, I am in Newton shoes about 98% of the time. (I wear dress shoes to church, sorry!) My injuries have been an emotional journey and I am finally back to normal and now in the best shape of my life.</p>

				<p><em>By Douglas Bertram, MTCM, L.Ac.</em></p>
<p>Several studies have shown a direct link between Achilles tendon length and the amount of energy the tendon can store. The tendo-muscular structures of the posterior lower leg often become shortened by wearing shoes with an elevated heel. Shorter tendo-muscular structures significantly reduce the elastic recoil potential; therefore it is recommended to wear level running shoes. The ramp angle or heel-toe drop is determined by measuring the difference of height between the heel and the forefoot of a shoe. A heel-toe drop of more than 3-4mm will start to change the ability for the tissue of the posterior leg to store and release energy.</p>
<p>The plantar fascia also acts as an important spring. When landing on the mid-foot/forefoot with the foot under the center of mass, the longitudinal arch should lengthen. This lengthening of the arch stretches the plantar fascia and aids in shock absorption as well as increased elastic recoil. By releasing the stored energy from the plantar fascia, significantly less active muscular effort is needed to lift the foot back off the ground. Less active push off means less wasted energy. In order for the arch to naturally lengthen there must be enough room in the shoe. Ridged structures “supporting” the arch do not allow for this natural motion. Stiff running shoes and rigid hard plastic orthotics might have a place for some foot pathologies, but will significantly alter the natural spring mechanics of efficient running.</p>
<p>A slow cadence has the same effect of reducing efficiency. Optimal cadence is around 180 steps per minute because this is the speed of which tendon is able to store and release energy. It is the frequency of elastic recoil. Shoes that are made of soft “cushioned” EVA foam will slow down your cadence because it interferes with the body’s ability to sense the ground. The more “cushion” between your foot and the ground, the more time your foot will stay on the ground due to a reduction in afferent feedback. The quicker the foot can find the ground, become stable and release, the quicker your cadence will become. Most people will speed up their cadence by 10 -15 steps per minute by running barefoot or in lightweight firm shoes (firm under the ball of the foot, not the arch). Look for a shoe that offers a good amount of protection, yet gives good afferent feedback. This will help you take advantage of the passive energy of elastic recoil and make you a more efficient runner.</p>
<p><strong>Finding The Proper Fit </strong></p>
<p>Standing with your heels pulled to the back of your shoes, you should have at least a thumb’s width in front of your longest toe. Many people wear their shoes too short, too narrow and laced too tight. The ball of your foot freely spreads upon loading, allowing the spring-like mechanism of the longitudinal arch to lengthen, and the transverse arch (from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 5<sup>th</sup> metatarsal head) to widen. The spreading of the foot aides in both shock absorption and stabilization, as well as helps facilitate the mechanics of elastic recoil. If the shoe is too narrow and the arch too stiff, natural motion of the foot is prevented.</p>
<p>Lacing a shoe too tightly is a habit that forms from running in a shoe with a significant ramp angle, where the foot tends to slide forward, thus creating the need to lace tightly to prevent this motion. When transitioning into a level shoe, there is not the same need to stop this forward motion. The foot needs room to rise and fall to be efficient.<em><br>

				<p>Some points were brought to our attention recently in Bobby McGee’s article “The Footstrike Debate” published in USA Triathlon (Summer 2011.) the person who brought this up seems to have missed some of the salient points from the article. Newton’s Director of Education, Ian Adamson has addressed these points in both a short and long version. Read on and be enlightened!</p>
<h2>Short</h2>
<p>1. <strong><em>“Good runners heel strike for long distance”</em></strong></p>
<p>Let’s be clear, McGee says “Good runners also tend to heel strike when they run long and slow.” This is true in affluent societies where runners overwhelmingly have adapted to running on shoes with soft midsoles and a large heel lift (12 -22 mm for regular trainers, 8 to 14 mm for racing flats.) For runners in the 5.5 Billion people on our planet who can’t afford big bulky shoes this is not true. If one examines evidence based science and don’t believe the anecdotes, this is this is fact, Lieberman et al (Nature Vol 463, 28 January 2010, 531-536.) You can certainly find examples of elite runners who have a proprioceptive heel striking phase (such as Gebrselassie), but this is not a true heel loading strike, even as McGee defines it.</p>
<p>2. <em><strong>“Transitioning from heel to midfoot is precarious and seldom achieved without injury”</strong></em><br>
<em><strong> (I’m glad I finally heard somebody actually say this, I’ve been struggling to convert to midfoot strike because everybody is doing it and it caused me injuries that I”m still fighting)</strong></em></p>
<p>There is no evidence to support this. Consider barefoot running, which is probably the most extreme adaptation for a western runner who has habituated to a soft soled, heel lifted shoe. A systematic review of the literature published in Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association [one of the most conservative when it comes to viewing footwear and running gait] (101)3: 231-246, 2011, found that “Although there is no evidence that either confirms or refutes improved performance and reduced injuries in barefoot runners, many of the claimed disadvantages to barefoot running are not supported by the literature. Nonetheless, it seems that barefoot running may be an acceptable training method for athletes and coaches who understand and can minimize the risks.”</p>
<p>The reality is progressive injury results from trying to adapt too rapidly. The majority of runners in our society spent years of decades adapting to big bulky western style running shoes and have become very efficient at running inefficiently. Humans have the ability to adapt to a large variety of unnatural conditions (heat, cold altitude, deep sea diving, wearing big soft high heel shoes), but this doesn’t mean the conditions are optimal for performance.</p>
<p>This does raise the question of what is natural. If one considers the barefoot as the natural condition for running (4.5 million years of hominid/human evolution according to the fossil record) compared to a big soft bulky shoe (40 years of modern running shoe evolution), which one is the natural condition? There is a valid argument that we need to protect our body from hard modern surfaces, which to some extent is true. But then again, they are not exactly absent in the natural world, and humans have had foot coverings for at least 5,500 years according to carbon dates artifacts. The Iceman from oAustria has straw stuffed moccasins to protect from the sharp ice and cold, good idea!</p>
<p>3. <em><strong>“Of the six US men in the ITU world championships last year, four were heel strikers.”  (Wow)</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, wow, but not true. Do an image search and see how many true rear foot strikes you can see. They also placed 14th (Bennet – forefoot), 16th (Chrabot – forefoot), 51st (Shoemaker – forefoot), 56th (Collington – forefoot), 58th (Huerta- mid foot, possibly rear foot at times), 66th and last (Foster – wholefoot, possibly rear foot). Search for any elite runners and you will see predominantly forefoot/wholefoot/midfoot loading.</p>
<h2>Long</h2>
<p>Bobby McGee’s primary points in his article “The Footstrike Debate” published in USA Triathlon (Summer 2011) are not so much about where you land on your foot as your body position and loading angles.</p>
<p>1.	McGee uses examples of athletes who successfully “heel strike”, but here’s the rub (and this later explained, see 11. below), you still need a good body position and appropriate joint angles (limb positions.) The main thing missing is a definition of “heel strike.” An often misinterpreted study by Hasewage et al (2007) showed that 38% of the top 50 runners in a half marathon (at the 15 km mark) run midfoot or forefoot, and that ground contact time decreases the faster they go. This was true of all runners, with GC time increasing for all runners as they run slower. Interestingly the definition of foot strike was when the shoe first contacts the ground. When you examine this more closely it turns out that what the geometry of the shoe has a huge effect on what touches the ground and when. Virtually every runner was wearing a heel lifted shoe (i.e. one where the heel is thicker than the forefoot), so if you control for heel thickness, the number of forefoot and midfoot strikers goes up to about 60%. Look even deeper and you find that these runners are not truly rear foot loading (see impact transient in 10. below), but are in fact running forefoot or midfoot (or whole foot) loading. McGee does a good job of describing how to do this later in his article.</p>
<p>2.	Running on your toes is impossible. This is at least extremely difficult unless you include sprinting, in which case it’s only possible for very short distances.</p>
<p>3.	Top (tri)athletes succeed with various foot engagement styles. Success is relative – Craig Alexander runs faster than virtually any other distance triathlete using midfoot/whole foot strike, and he’s one of the oldest professional triathletes.</p>
<p>4.	“Transitioning from heel to midfoot is precarious and seldom achieved without injury.” Making any change too fast can lead to injury, whether that is changing your running style, introducing speed work, strength, intensity, volume, altitude, heat, cold etc. Try and climb an 8,000 m peak without acclimatization or supplemental oxygen and you will die, try and run in Death Valley in the middle of summer without heat acclimatization and you will die, try to change the loading patterns on your foot strike and you won’t die, but you’d better make sure you do it with plenty of time to strengthen the soft tissue and fine boney structures of your feet so you don;t get injured.</p>
<p>5.	You shouldn’t try and keep your heel off the ground. Absolutely correct, in fact this is a common mistake and leading cause of injury for people adapting too fast to a midfoot/whole foot/forefoot strike.</p>
<p>6.	It’s unlikely that foot position can lead to effective change. This is largely true, foot placement is more important, as in where in relation to the body it engages the ground.</p>
<p>7.	Place your foot so that it is neutral or moving back relative to the ground. This is absolutely the most efficient way to engage and extremely difficult to do if you have your leg out in front of your body.</p>
<p>8.	Allow your heel to settle and your (longitudinal) arch and Achilles tendon load like a spring. This is true, and actually engages the stretch reflex to assist with elastic recoil. Difficult in a heel striking gait, at least severely limited because the Achilles is already extended in a dorsiflexed position.</p>
<p>9.	Consider barefoot running as the outer end of the midfoot/whole foot spectrum of runners. A systematic review of the literature published in Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association (101)3: 231-246, 2011, found that “Although there is no evidence that either confirms or refutes improved performance and reduced injuries in barefoot runners, many of the claimed disadvantages to barefoot running are not supported by the literature. Nonetheless, it seems that barefoot running may be an acceptable training method for athletes and coaches who understand and can minimize the risks.”</p>
<p>10.	When you review the evidence based science that examines foot position and ground impact forces, the facts are clear. Lieberman et al (Nature Vol 463, 28 January 2010, 531-536) found there is a large variation in the impact transients when comparing forefoot strike (FFS) runners to rear foot (heel) strike (RFS) runners. Impact transient is the rate and magnitude of loading on initial ground contact. It turns out that the impact transient for shod runners who RFS is three times higher than barefoot runners who FFS, and seven times higher for barefoot runners who RFS. The study found that the impact transient is largely absent for FFS runners, regardless of wearing footwear or not. Here’s an excerpt from the article: “Humans have engaged in endurance running for millions of years1, but the modern running shoe was not invented until the 1970s. For most of human evolutionary history, runners were either barefoot or wore minimal footwear such as sandals or moccasins with smaller heels and little cushioning relative to modern running shoes. We wondered how runners coped with the impact caused by the foot colliding with the ground before the invention of the modern shoe. Here we show that habitually barefoot endurance runners often land on the fore-foot (fore-foot strike) before bringing down the heel, but they sometimes land with a flat foot (mid-foot strike) or, less often, on the heel (rear-foot strike). In contrast, habitually shod runners mostly rear-foot strike, facilitated by the elevated and cushioned heel of the modern running shoe. Kinematic and kinetic analyses show that even on hard surfaces, barefoot runners who fore-foot strike generate smaller collision forces than shod rear-foot strikers. This difference results primarily from a more plantar flexed foot at landing and more ankle compliance during impact, decreasing the effective mass of the body that collides with the ground. Fore-foot- and mid-foot-strike gaits were probably more common when humans ran barefoot or in minimal shoes, and may protect the feet and lower limbs from some of the impact related injuries now experienced by a high percentage of runners.”</p>
<p>11.	“… If your shin is leaning rearward, even slightly, you are running with the brakes on -” This is absolutely correct. McGee is describing over striding, where you land with your foot in front of your center of mass. This is the most typical heel strike, and is one of the greatest inefficiencies in running.</p>

				<p>Every triathlete knows that the transition from bike to run is a beast. After hours of being hunched over the handlebars with the legs spinning, trying to regain uprightness and establish a running rhythm is a “make it or break it” for most racers. There are several reasons why Newton Running shoes and Newton Natural Running Form can make T-2 feel Natural.</p>
<p>Getting off of the bike, the hamstrings and hip flexors are going to be tight.  This is only a problem if you try to run with a long stride.  If you take short quick steps that mimic your cycling cadence, there is far less adjustment.  Newton Running Shoes are built on a level platform to help you land under the center of mass instead of loading the foot out in front of the body.  They have an external forefoot technology, the lugs, that sit on top of a stretch membrane which store and release energy.  This helps tired legs get off the ground and keeps the cadence high. If the athlete can find reasonable upright posture and commit to a nice forward lean, they will return to using the large efficient hip flexors to lift the thigh.  This becomes a “controlled fall”, letting gravity do the work.</p>
<p>The toe box of a Newton Running shoe is nice and wide making room for the foot to spread, even if a little swollen.  Having room for the foot to spread is very important when trying to run efficiently. Only when the foot is able to spread will the passive energy of the stretched connective tissue in the longitudinal and transverse arch recoil.  This elastic recoil does not require effort, and will replace the need to push off.  Most triathletes will reach a point of total fatigue of their glutes. The glutes are responsible for stabilization of the pelvis in the stance phase of the running gait.  The quicker a runner can stabilize in the stance phase the less the gluts have to work.  Newton Running shoes have a firm plate under the ball of the foot that greatly improves afferent feedback or the ability to feel the ground.  The quicker a runner can feel the ground, the quicker they can stabilize in stance phase and the less they tax those fatigued glutes.</p>
<p>Getting off the bike in your next race can be a much more natural transition with Newton Running shoes and Newton Natural Running Form, it’s simple physics!</p>

Wanting to know more about his amazing victory — he won by five minutes in a time of 2:38– I fired off several questions to Mark and he  quickly responded.  So without further delay, here’s our exchange. But first, all of us who are involved with the Natural Running Center, are extremely proud of the NRC’s co-founder and executive director who showed that age should be no barrier or hindrance to performance. — Bill Katovsky</em></p>
<p><strong>You last won this race in 2006.  What were the differences between now and then in terms of your training?</strong></p>
<p>I last won this race in 2006 just shy of my fortieth birthday.  In 2006 life was a lot less busy.  I had time then to focus more on my running and do some of the harder sessions necessary to run fast.  Currently running fits 100 percent  in the relaxation part of my day; if it did not the running and life in general would not be sustainable.  In 2006 I would do marathon pace 2 hour runs in the 6 weeks leading into a marathon.  Now my long runs are all relaxed and low heart rate, and no more than 2 hours.  I did no traditional interval sessions then and I do not do these now either.  I do really short neuromuscular work several times a week with 4 short 50 meter strides and light skipping drills to wake up the recoil and springiness in my stride. In 2006 I started to run in level shoes, now I run barefoot or minimalist in training. So that’s another progression.</p>
<p><strong>How many times have you done this race?</strong></p>
<p>Looking back this was my eighth race and sixth in a row.  I was second in the inaugural race losing to a college rival runner Andy Herr out of NC State.  He beat me in college XC and translated that to the marathon.</p>
<p>Here are the years, times, and place</p>
<p>1995                  2:32                  2<sup>nd</sup></p>
<p>1996                  2:34                  3<sup>rd</sup></p>
<p>2006                 2:31                  1<sup>st</sup></p>
<p>2007                 2:34                  5<sup>th</sup></p>
<p>2008                 2:39                  6<sup>th</sup></p>
<p>2009                 2:44                  4<sup>th</sup></p>
<p>2010                 2:42                  5<sup>th</sup></p>
<p>2011                  2:38                  1<sup>st</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One other note. Out of close to 80 marathons that I have raced, only have 2 have been over 2:45 and 24 of last 25 years with a marathon under 2:40, 22 of the years under 2:35.</p>

<p><strong>What shoes did you wear in 2006? And in Saturday’s race?</strong></p>
<p>In 2006 I was wearing a Brooks Burn. I was sponsored by them at the time.In 2011 I wore the new Newton MV2.  This is a 5-ounce zero-drop shoe which is firm and responsive.</p>
<p><strong>Given that a majority of your training is barefoot, what are the differences in racing shod?</strong></p>
<p>I want something with a close to barefoot feel; that is a firm shoe with no heel elevation.  Also need a nice toe-box so I can use my “Correct Toes”. These keep my big toe in the right position for stability and spring.  You can run faster on this course in shoes than barefoot.  There are lots of rough stretches of pavement which would be tough at 6 minute pace in bare feet.  To race a marathon you need to be in total relaxation mode and let it go.  Barefoot on unfamiliar textured terrain is a challenge in itself.  You can go more reckless in shoes too as you can get away with flying down the hills, and which is a good thing in a race.  The Newtons are different as they are not traditional soft foam, but rather a firm TPU membrane with recoil properties.  To me this enhances efficiency, and does not sap it away like traditional EVA.</p>
<p><strong>Will you ever run a full marathon barefoot?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, I need to find a nice scenic course with a good smooth road.  I would not “race” this either and rather focus on smooth technique and enjoying the day.  I ran Big Sur several years ago.  This would be a nice barefoot run, or Napa Valley and finish with a nice glass of red.</p>
<p><strong>How many miles do you train per week? And do you do any other sports or physical activities?</strong></p>
<p>I probably log 50-60 miles with a long run of 1:45-2 hours.  I play in the backyard often with my dog and kids.</p>
<p><strong>With your incredibly busy schedule of being a family physician, owner of Two Rivers Treads, and frequent travel to speak at sports medicine conferences and clinics, how do you even find time to run?</strong></p>
<p>I run when there is opportunity, often very early in the morning and sometimes at lunch.  The beauty of running is that you can run anywhere and anytime.  I have a headlamp for running in the dark</p>
<p><strong>Does everyday stress ever affect your training?</strong></p>
<p>I use my running (and deliberately shun the word “training”) as the daily reset button.  The harder and busier the day is the more I need to do an easy run.  This relaxation counters the sometimes toxic levels of stress that comes with being overextended.  If running were another stress it would not be sustainable, therefore all of my running is relaxed. Often people read schedules developed by elite athletes and they have weekly strenuous sessions. Now if you are an elite athlete and the rest of your day is the relaxing part then you can add frequent stressful workouts.  For 99.9 percent of all runners this is <em>not</em> the case.  We all have busy and stressful lives and the running must fit into the “yin” of the “yin and yang” circle.</p>
<p><strong>How did you celebrate after the win? Were your legs sore?</strong></p>
<p>I have a trace of soreness now 24 hours after the race.  At the post-race tent I celebrated with teammates with a few beers, a pizza, and later  2 glasses of wine (good mixed fat, protein, and carb recovery).  When I got home that night my family had a nice Boston Crème pie waiting.  This was the real celebration.  To my two kids, it was if I had won the Olympics.  I brought home a really big trophy and they loved it. They made me congratulation cards with crayon drawings of Daddy leading the pack. On Sunday morning I ran 40 minutes barefoot and felt really good considering the hard 26 yesterday.  I even mowed the grass too for an hour with a push mower.</p>

Were you in a state of suspended disbelief, thinking “where is everyone?”</strong></p>
<p>When you run a marathon you just focus on your own pace and feeling.  I had plenty of company with a police lead car and 4 Military Police on bikes next to me.  So at least I felt safe and did not need to think about turn. I just looked ahead at the car.  There were tons of spectators out in the towns, at the aid stations, and on base. So it was never lonely.  At least 20 bands too and since I was the first runner they really cranked it up.  Heard some AC/DC, Zeppelin, Elvis, and lots of other spirited tunes to give me a little boost.</p>
<p><strong>How many other runners in their 40s in the U.S. can go sub 2:40?</strong></p>
<p>There are quite a few 40 year old runners who can run this time; at 45 years, not too many</p>
<p><strong>How was this race different than Boston 2011 when you ran 2:37?</strong></p>
<p>I consider the solo 2:38 yesterday a better performance.  In Boston we had a nice tailwind, there are no turns, and there is always either a group to break the wind or another runner you are chasing.  To solo run a 2:38 on a course with several hills takes more effort.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the runners in the Air Force marathon were half your age!  Yet, you were able to flick on your afterburners for  26.2 miles and they weren’t.  Why is this so?  How does one build up endurance <em>and</em> speed?</strong></p>

<p>I do almost all my running is very relaxed at a  heart rate  of about 145 or lower and do supplemental short 50 meter sprints and light plyometrics to keep the range of motion and “quickness”.  You want to be able to run “fast” without running “hard.” That is the secret.</p>
<p>I work on kinetic chain strength and stability also by spending a lot of time standing on one leg.  I do not have a chair at my desk and do most of my working at a stand up desk.</p>
<p><strong>The day before the race you were on your feet the entire day giving talks on footwear education and running. What were some of the topics you covered? And, weren’t you tired by the end of the day? So much for taking it easy the day before the race.</strong></p>

We are tasked to build self instruction modules for soldiers on aerobic development, core strength for running, and running mechanics.  The talks brought much interest and curiosity.  Runners cornered me for an hour after each of these talks to get advice on their injuries.</p>
<p><strong>What did you eat the morning of the race? Did you eat or drink anything during the race?</strong></p>
<p>My usual breakfast is several cups of good coffee (this is normal for me), a couple bagels with peanut butter, and a banana.  I eat about 2 hours before the start and then have a Power Gel at the start.  I use a Power Gel every 30 minutes during the race and take only water.  I do not drink beyond what my body senses. So maybe 20 ounces along the way yesterday.  It was cool.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. George Sheehan, the late philosopher king of running, dealt with his declining marathon times by cutting back on the frequency of runs per week. Instead of going five miles a day, six times a week, he reduced that amount to running three times a week while boosting his mileage to ten miles per run. He was still running thirty miles per week, but it was offset by additional rest days. He stuck to this training regimen for three years, and at the age of sixty-two, Sheehan set a personal best in the marathon by going 3:01. Can you see yourself going even faster in the marathon in years to come?</strong></p>
<p>I think I could run faster if I chose a goal race and life calmed down enough to do some of the necessary harder sessions to really get into “race” shape.  Currently, there’s not enough time to sleep and recover so the running can only be easy.  With the right prep and the right race I think I can go under 2:30 again.  I’ve run under 2:25 a couple times in my 20’s, but doubt I’ll get there again.  But really the times don’t matter.  I’m happy to be able to wake up and run pain free even if I never raced again.  In some ways though I feel obligated to jump into the races since a big mission of the Natural Running Center, Two Rivers Treads, and the United States Air Force Efficient Running is sustainable running. If I were just another “former runner” trying to tell folks what to do it would have no credibility or relevance.  I’m learning and experimenting everyday too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What’s up next on Dr. Mark’s race calendar?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest running challenge is a race where I’m not running but directing.  On October 1, we’re hosting nearly 3000 runners in Shepherdstown with Freedom’s Run (www.freedomsrun.org).  I direct the race and believe me that when I say running a marathon is easy; you just show up. Finally, come see our new Two Rivers Treads blog called<a href=""http://runshepherd.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://runshepherd.com/', 'Run Shepherd.');""><strong>Run Shepherd.</strong></a> We just posted a short video of one returning Freedom’ s Run competitor, Don Taylor, who is 80 years old!</p>
<p>I have Marine Corps Marathon late October. I will be part of Air Force team.  This will be my nineteenth Marine Corps. This was my first marathon in 1988 and I ran a 2:34. It would be fun to achieve that time again. I will run the JFK 50 mile in November to finish the fall running season.</p>

				<p>This coming Sunday, September 11 is the first time that the Ironman 70.3 World Championships heads to Las Vegas. For the first time since 2007 2-time Ironman World Champ and Newton athlete Craig Alexander will be toeing the line. We had a chance to have a quick chat with Craig to check in before the first of two big races.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Isaac:</strong> So Craig, are you excited for the race this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>Craig Alexander: </strong>I am! You know, I haven’t really raced much this year since I was dealing with a viral infection that kind of threw off my schedule. I got my Kona slot by winning at Ironman Coeur d’Alene and felt great in that race. Now I’m really feeling good and rested.</p>
<p><strong>SI:</strong> After having been away from Ironman 70.3 World’s for a few years, do you have any feelings going into it?</p>
<p><strong>CA: </strong>I’m excited, you know? I’ve always felt that this is my best distance and I always do a 70.3 four weeks out from Kona (Ironman 70.3 Muskoka) so this fits right in with that. I went back to Clearwater (the former site of the Ironman 70.3 World’s) in 2007 because I though it was the right thing to do after having won the title in 2006 but I haven’t been back since. It’s always a hard doing Kona and then doing a 70.3 four weeks later.</p>
<p><strong>SI:</strong> Any thoughts on the new venue in Las Vegas versus Clearwater?</p>
<p><strong>CA: </strong> The new course is a bit more of a test and certainly not as flat as the course in Clearwater. The wind in Vegas can often be a good test to see what it’ll be like in Kona.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>SI:</strong> How does this race fit into your training and lead up to Kona?</p>
<p><strong>CA:</strong> The timing of this race is better with 70.3 World’s coming before Kona. As I mentioned before, since I normally do a 70.3 four weeks out from Kona, I haven’t really had to change my schedule for this race. I am focused on this race though. I’m going into this weekend thinking there’s nothing else on the schedule.</p>
<p><strong>SI: </strong>Knowing that the new MV² is available, what model of Newton will we see you in this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>CA: </strong>I’ve always worn the Distance S so I’m going to stick with what I know works and what I’m used to. The MV² is a great shoe but it’s not something that I’d want to switch to halfway through the season.</p>
<p><strong>SI:</strong> On a slightly different note, what’s your favorite pre-race dinner?</p>
<p><strong>CA:</strong> Usually pasta with some protein, maybe some chicken. I have a pretty good diet in general so I don’t really have to change it too much. I think your body gets used to eating a certain way and it’s best to just stick with what works.</p>
<p><strong>SI:</strong> What are Aussie’s (Craig’s son) long runs up to now?</p>
<p><strong>CA:</strong> About the length of the driveway! Actually he’s more into ball sports like football (soccer for us Americans in the crowd). Lucy (Craig’s daughter) is actually more of the endurance athlete. She’s at swim squad several days a week and is running races here and there.</p>
<p>We’d like to wish Craig all the best this weekend in Las Vegas. The whole crew here in Boulder as well as as those in Las Vegas will be cheering every swim stroke, turn of the pedals and step of the run! Go get ’em Craig!</p>

				<p>Over 1,000 athletes showed up Saturday, September 17<sup>th</sup>, 2011 for the Hy-Vee Ironkids National Championships in West Des Moines, IA.  A cold front turned the triathlon championships into a duathlon. The traditional 300 yard swim portion of the triathlon was substituted with a 1200 meter run in the senior division. Winter Vinecki, age 12, (racing  age 13 y/o female division based on USAT age-up rules) was able to strategically adjust her race strategy to help her achieve her second consecutive IronKids National Championship Title.</p>
<p><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0053.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-3275"" title=""Winter Defends IronKids National Championship"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0053-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0053-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0053-1024x685.jpg 1024w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px""></a>Winter used the opening 1200 yard run to quickly open up an early lead coming into the first transition. Though the rain held off during the race, an early morning rain shower just minutes before the start was enough to create hazardous conditions on the bike course. Turns proved to be extremely slippery, as many riders lost control and fell off their bikes. Despite a slick road surface, Winter was able to maintain an 18.7 mph average on the bike, which turned out to be the fastest bike split in her age division and the second fastest female bike split of the day.</p>
<p>Heading out onto the two mile run course, Winter followed tightly behind her main rival, Gina Johnson, matching her stride-for-stride. A time-trial start gave Winter a 12-second advantage despite being a few steps behind her friend and fellow competitor. Fighting side cramps half-way through the race, Winter summoned her inner strength, reflecting on the fact that no pain she was encountering could match that of which her dad endured during his losing battle with prostate cancer.  The cramps subsided and it was a sprint to the finish. Gina tried to open the gap with 100 yards to go but Winter quickly responded with the speed and determination she has shown all season. Winter narrowed the gap enough to take an 8-second victory over Johnson and secure a repeat performance as the 2011 Ironkids National Champion.</p>
<p>Tears of both joy and heartbreak were exchanged across the finish line as both Gina and<a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0102.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-3276"" title=""Winter Defends IronKids National Championship"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0102-200x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0102-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0102-685x1024.jpg 685w"" sizes=""(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px""></a> Winter embraced one another in the spirit of the sport.  As she crossed the finish line, Winter looked up and pointed to the sky in a subtle dedication to her father. “This one is for you Dad!”</p>
<p>Winter continues to defy the odds season after season.  In the days leading into most races, while other athletes are resting and off their feet, Winter undertakes a grueling schedule. Her coaches beg her to sleep-in, stay off of her feet, rest and hydrate 24 hours before competition.  However, with her job as Ironkids Ambassador and her duty to Team Winter, such luxuries are often not fathomable. Speaking at schools before and after Ironkids events, she delivers inspirational and motivational talks to kids, preaching about the benefits of leading a healthy, active and positive lifestyle. The day before races, Winter speaks at pre-race meetings and works at the Team Winter expo tent. Though busier than most athletes could possibly imagine, she never turns down an opportunity to talk to a young athlete, sign an autograph, give race tips or pose for a photograph.</p>
<p>For Winter, defending her championship runs much deeper than the simply joy of victory. With an inner drive fueled by her goal of finding a cure for cancer, she relishes in the fact that with each large-scale victory, her message becomes that much louder. For every victory she receives, her first place IronKids trophy is given to a family affected by prostate cancer. Last year’s National Championship trophy does not sit on the family mantel. It is in the hands of Michael Milken; a prostate cancer survivor and founder of the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Since the founding of Team Winter in 2008, Winter and her Team Winter athletes have helped raise over $300,000 for prostate cancer awareness and research. She will proudly distribute all eight of her first place IronKids trophies from the 2011 season, including her National Champion trophy, to various families; reminding them that someone is out there fighting for them to ensure that one day, people will no longer have to suffer from this all-too-common affliction.</p>
<p>As a means of raising awareness for prostate cancer on a global scale, Winter will be launching a world marathon tour. Beginning in the Spring of 2012, she will be running a marathon in every continent over the next two years in the hopes of raising funds and furthering the awareness of prostate cancer in areas she has yet to traverse.

Well, this past Saturday, on a blisteringly hot day in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, the man affectionately known as “Crowie” grabbed yet another victory from the world’s best triathletes.</p>
<p>The day began with the pro field (greatly reduced thanks to the new Kona qualifying system for pros) starting at 6:30 AM. With former All-American swimmer Andy Potts out of the water ahead of everyone, Craig was in the first pack behind Potts with the majority of the pros in a time of 51:56.</p>
<p>As expected Craig’s transition was without incident and he was soon on the bike. If there were any doubts about how fierce a competitor Craig could be on the bike, they were erased as Craig stayed at or near the point of the spear on the ride out to the town of Hawi. For his part, Crowie proved not only was he a fierce competitor but that he can also throw. down a blistering bike leg by shaving a full thirteen minutes off his previous best bike split in Kona.</p>
<p>Craig left T2 about 4:30 down but quickly made the pass to take the lead. The battle which<a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/312917_10150312422346986_122637006985_8368320_1134265825_n.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-3368"" title='""Crowie Editition"" Distance S' src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/312917_10150312422346986_122637006985_8368320_1134265825_n-224x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""224"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/312917_10150312422346986_122637006985_8368320_1134265825_n-224x300.jpg 224w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/312917_10150312422346986_122637006985_8368320_1134265825_n.jpg 717w"" sizes=""(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px""></a> was expected from Andreas Realert did come, but never in a head-to-head match-up as the triathlon world had predicted. With Craig running his usual fleet-footed and efficient marathon, his lead began to get bigger and bigger after the half marathon. The “Crowie Edition” Newton Distance S’ on his feet were a blur of bright yellow as he tore through the Energy Lab. However, fans everywhere collectively gasped as, with about 2 km to go, Craig pulled up to stretch obvious hamstring cramps. After pulling it back together and bearing what must have been excruciating pain, Craig finally hit the last stretch on Ali’i Drive.</p>
<p>With the crowd going crazy and Craig picking the Australian flag from a spectator, it was pretty clear that he was unaware of just how close he was to history. Those of us watching the live stream and some near the finish were well aware that Crowie was withing seconds of breaking Luc Van Lierde’s  fifteen year old course record of 8:04:08. As he approached the finish line and finally got a glimpse of the clock, reality hit Craig. Sprinting the last few meters, he leaped across the finish line and into Ironman history in a course record time of 8:03:56.</p>
<p>With his win, Craig became only the fourth man ever to win three or more Ironman World Championships. He is also the oldest winner of the race at 38 years old and is the first person to ever win both the Ironman 70.3 World Championship and the Ironman World Championship at any time AND the only person to hold both titles in the same year!</p>
<p>The super bright colors of Newton Running were well well represented on the course in Kona as always. We’d like to extend a big congratulations to all the Newton runners who tore up the roads of Kailua-Kona this past weekend!</p>
<p>All of us at Newton Running would like to congratulate Craig on not only being an amazing person, sportsman and father, but for being the embodiment of a true gentleman and athlete. Congrats Craig! Here’s to #4!</p>

<p>Prior to beginning the race report, I would be remiss if I did not mention and profusely thank my kick-ass crew from this event: Justin Andrews (Crew Chief), Mike Danenberg, and Jeff Daniels. They took a week of their lives and steadfastly devoted it to me, and my success at this race. Thank you so much for everything you did not only on the three days of racing, but also leading up to and afterwards. It is true what another finisher said about the event, it is 100% crew. We named our motley crew (with the help of my father) Team RedAssdMonkey, and were outfitted head to toe as such. Even our car was hilarious, and had a red blow-up dragon named “Welshie” tied to the top for three days. (See photo to left.)</p>
<p><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011-09-03_06-59-44_291.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-3349"" title=""2011-09-03_06-59-44_291"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011-09-03_06-59-44_291.jpg"" alt="""" width=""255"" height=""191""></a> At the race breakfast the day prior to the start, the announcer did a beautiful job telling the history of Ultraman, and making us feel part of an elite group. I found out that I would be one of 127 women ever to complete an Ultraman since 1983 on Monday (if things went well), and this was great motivation. There are less than 750 finishers male and female—ever. He also said two things that I could hear in my head when things got rough the entire weekend, and especially on the first day: 1) No Whining (he called it “wingeing”), and 2) If you don’t want to deal with the elements and excitement, go run a local 5k.</p>
<p>Also, I must say that participating, competing in and completing this event has changed my racing perspective forever. The sense of family present at Ultraman is contagious, and it was a blast sharing the course with only 29 other racers from 15 countries and their crews. You get to know each and every person, and it is very special. I made friends for life—what a bond!</p>
<p>Ultraman UK is a different animal due to the harsh nature of the last great wilderness in the United Kingdom—which was to be our course and stage for the ensuing three days. Yet, coming to Ultraman UK and complaining about the weather/elements would be akin to doing the Badwater 135-Mile Ultramarathon and expecting it not to be hot.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1: 10k swim, 90-mile (143k) bike</strong></p>
<p>I am not a person with many fears. That is why and how I simply jump right in and do<a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20110904-00071.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-3350"" title=""IMG-20110904-00071"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20110904-00071.jpg"" alt="""" width=""195"" height=""262""></a> things of this magnitude without really a second thought. Even though I am not the best or fastest swimmer, I was totally undaunted by the 10k distance. I had completed several extremely long training swims in open water and the pool, and I believed in my heart that I was ready. Wrong! What I did not anticipate was the wind and cold—inside and out of the water. I despise cold water. It is one of the things in this world that I dislike more than any other. It is almost, but not quite funny. Well, now it is funny, I suppose.</p>
<p>Arriving six days prior to the race, I thought maybe I would have a chance to get in the water and check it out since I had heard it was “pretty cold.” The first day we were there, Justin and I drove out to Bala Lake to see for ourselves. The wind was howling, it was in the mid-50s outside and the lake temperature was about 52 degrees. I walked to the water’s edge, put my hand in it, turned chalk white and without a word walked back to the car to leave. No freaking way! The water I had been training in for months here in Charlotte was mid-80s! And it is mid-90s outside! Certain that I’d be sick before even towing the line if I swam that day, I made the executive decision to skip it. No, thank you, Bala Lake.</p>
<p><a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011-09-04_15-26-39_53.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-3351"" title=""2011-09-04_15-26-39_53"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011-09-04_15-26-39_53.jpg"" alt="""" width=""255"" height=""194""></a>At the race breakfast, there were all sorts of discussions about how the locals do not even swim in that lake because it is so cold—let alone for 10k. Talk of hypothermia and how to stay warm abounded. I left there even more concerned, and more nervous than I had been for anything in my short racing career. Finally, I was about to confront a real fear. At dinner that night, I admitted to my crew that I was very concerned about the water; however, I did not tell them that I was so concerned I worried I would not finish that leg of the race. Thoughts of mentally preparing for this event for nine months, completing four Ironmans back-to-back to ready myself, and swimming more than I ever have in my life all for naught danced in my head. I was going crazy.</p>
<p>Race morning it was absolutely freezing outside with 35mph winds. Perfect! The entire way to the lake—about a 30-minute drive—I did not say a word. We were the first ones there, which meant I had plenty of time to stare at the freezing cold water that today also had white caps. I was so bundled up you could not even see my face. The race director jokingly said, “You sure you can do this?” He didn’t realize that he said exactly what I was thinking! The Canadian and Welsh racers seemed just fine. They were used to the cold. The Welsh used to the wind and rain. It was really annoying at the time. Both thought the water was okay. Grrrrr.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time to swim. To my credit, I had not actually been complaining out loud at all during this time. All of this had been going on in my head, and I am certain it was written all over my face. Yet, when the time came, I put my wetsuit on, lubed up my face with Vaseline so it didn’t go into shock in the water, donned booties for my feet and went for it. My amazing crew had hot water ready to pour down my wetsuit right before the gun went off, and I think this helped immensely. If you are ever going to do a cold water swim, keep peeing in your wetsuit and be certain to pour warm water down it before the start. Plus, make sure your booties fit! Mine were too big and really slowed me down; however, there was NO WAY I was going to take them off.</p>
<p>Once I got in the water, I resigned to shut up or get out. So I just started swimming. The swim was set up to be one mile out, one mile back—times three.</p>
<p>It was really, really choppy because of the wind on the way out to the turn buoy, but then we had a tail wind on the return trip to shore. In theory, this sounds great. But, a couple of the buoys had gotten loose due to the crazy winds. Some people benefited greatly from this, and others of us got the rough end of the stick. The faster swimmers made it to the far buoy two different times while it was still loose and closer to shore—which means they swam a shorter distance AND had ridiculously fast times. Like, world record—not possible for 10k—times. Once the race organizers realized that they had gotten out of the water too fast, the lovely people MOVED THE BUOYS on those of us still in the water. Not cool. In fact, I had two different buoys moved on me WHILE I WAS SWIMMING TO THEM. Talk about your head being messed with when you are already not well! That was a first. At one point, I was almost to a buoy and they picked it up and moved a LONG ways further.</p>
<p>I looked at a kayaker and said, “Where the hell did the buoy just go? It was just here!” She pointed WAY out in the lake. “I’m not swimming out there. No one else had to. Why are they moving buoys in the middle of the swim?” The answer did not make me happy.</p>
<p>My other personal favorite that I find funny now but almost made my head snap off at the time was, “Just swim straight,” following them moving a renegade buoy in the middle of the lake that I, of course, had followed out there. They took that buoy away and said I was too far out—that I shouldn’t have followed that buoy. Oh, that’s just great. If I could swim straight then I wouldn’t be the only ya-yo in the middle of lake now, would I?</p>
<p>The worst part of all of this is that more than half the field had ridiculously fast swim times thereby setting up their overall times to be shorter. So, for three days, I was working from a pretty serious deficit after the cluster in the swim. However, I am happy that I swam the distance of an Ultraman. I do not think they should have moved the buoys on the rest of us. They should have just put an asterisk on the results and said there were extenuating circumstances with the wind. I fought the rest of the weekend to make up some of this time. But not all of us did the same distance, and it was very frustrating—especially since the water was so cold. Some of us were in that cold water a long time. My swim time was 3:25 for 10k.</p>
<p>My transition was a disaster, and counted into the bike time for the day. The people who got out of the water in two hours were, well, only in the water for two hours! No one has ever done an Ultraman swim in two hours, by the way. Anyway, I digress again. Justin was trying to rush me out of transition, but I was frozen. I had to tell him to stop because I couldn’t move either shoulder—they were congealed—plus my feet and hands weren’t working. They poured hot water on my hands and set my feet in a bucket of warm water. Finally, after more than fifteen minutes, I was out of there and onto the bike. I didn’t realize that my brain wasn’t quite working yet at the time; but I took two wrong turns in the first seven miles. You do the math!</p>
<p>Eventually, I settled into the bike about the time that it started pouring down rain. Oh,<a href=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011-09-05_13-50-29_564.jpg""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-3352"" title=""2011-09-05_13-50-29_564"" src=""/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011-09-05_13-50-29_564.jpg"" alt="""" width=""255"" height=""191""></a> well. I really did not even care at this point. The wind was still howling with gusts up to 35mph, and I just put my head down and rode. I don’t really remember much of the rest of the day other than I was descending some pretty treacherous roads in wet conditions really fast on my tri bike. I started having fun, and couldn’t believe how hilly and narrow the route was. It was relentless. The crew did a great job trying to keep me going since I was having trouble getting to my nutrition in the wind. The traffic was REALLY close to us, and it was raining so hard that I couldn’t see where I was going. I would ride with my glasses down my nose until I had to descend, and then I would raise them so the rain didn’t cut my eyes. Crazy. Making some passes on this day following the disastrous swim helped my morale. At one point, we passed two people at the same time: one guy was actually IN his van because it was raining so hard, and the other I went flying by going UPhill. When it is rough outside, those kinds of things at least keep you entertained.</p>
<p>By far, these were the worst conditions I have ever raced in for an entire day. It was brutal. The wind, the cars, the cold water, the horizontal rain, and the terrain: all of it was crazy. I learned a lot about how to control my bike in these conditions—that’s for sure. And I conquered a huge fear of freezing cold water. Nothing will seem cold to me anymore! I finished the 90 miles in 5:40 but they add the transition to it (unfortunately), so it looks like 5:55. I will remember this for my next Ultraman.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: 171.4-mile bike (276k)</strong></p>
<p>The crew did an incredible job getting me home, fed and relaxed following a long and brutal Day 1 of racing. They were extremely organized, and whisked me right out of the finish area with a mylar blanket—reminding me not to be Chatty Kathy and to go home to get warm and dry. The race director and my crew were kind of cracking up at me because I opted to just ride my bike home. I was so soaking wet that it seemed to make more sense at the time. Now I realize that it is kind of funny. Anyway, as a result, I woke up on Day 2 feeling very fresh and ready to ride. Knowing full well that this day was going to be hard and long, I was excited to spend it doing what I love the most: riding my bike.</p>
<p>Although this course is extremely difficult and the grades are ridiculous, the sheer beauty of it is simply magnificent. I’ve raced in many gorgeous places, but I’ve never seen anything quite like this. Several hours into the bike on Day 2, I waved the crew car alongside me as I rode along the Irish Sea and said, “I have to admit, this doesn’t suck!” At this moment, I remembered something my ultra friend Charlie Engle always says to me, “No matter how good you are feeling, it will subside. No matter how bad you are feeling, it will go away, too.” I was feeling really good right then, but things were just about to get hard.</p>
<p>The most important thing on Day 2 was to remain focused and not waste any time on frivolous stops. Unfortunately, I had to go to the bathroom from the time we started, and this caused me to lose the people I wanted to keep in sight. It was way too early to pee of the bike! Each of my stops was quick and to the point, and there were three of them for bathroom breaks. I had one mechanical problem that caused me to lose some time when my derailleur kept skipping and finally went bonkers on one of our steepest climbs of the day at Mile 95. Do NOT unclip and try to fix something on a 16% grade! My crew was nowhere in sight, and I couldn’t get my foot back into the clips. Another crew found me hanging on the guardrail of the climb trying to re-clip. One of their members held me in position while I clipped back in and then ran me up the climb a bit to get momentum started again; but the damage was done. I had lost at least ten minutes messing with this, and I felt like a total spaz.</p>
<p>I was not happy with myself for the snap decision I made on that climb to attempt the derailleur fix alone, and I had to remember that I had been riding well up until that point. I had started to get negative, and I needed to change the mindset. I reminded myself that I had been descending better than I ever had in my life, and to keep moving forward. Remember the good moments of the day, and don’t start acting crazy even if you feel crazy. Bonkers takes too much energy. One of the highlights was that I had a 1:01 mile split descending a steep. 1:01! That is like 55mph and a new record for me. It was so fun.</p>
<p>Justin (who rides with me all of the time) said he has never seen me do anything so focused as the way I rode this day. I had only done one ride this long EVER, and I knew that wasted time was the killer. The Race Director (Simon) is a very sadistic man who decided to put some of the hardest climbs into the route right about the time you start to lose your marbles on a day this long—between miles 140-152. It seemed like we were climbing forever. I was waiting for a descent, and it never came—the route kept ascending. I was cursing Simon, but I kept moving. I knew this was the point that would make or break my day, and maybe my race. I made two passes during this time, and again—this gave me some momentum to shut it down for home. Other people were having a harder time than me.</p>
<p>Once I got through this labyrinth, which is what it seemed like to me, hell hath no fury like the way I rode for home. I was talking to myself, talking to the cars, whooping it up to the crew who were flawless yet again on a LONG day, and felt like I had nitro on my bike. Even though it rolled up and down back towards town, I stayed in my big ring and pushed the hills. I was NOT going over 11 hours, and I had lost some time in the past couple. I was like a pony that could smell the barn. Part of this was due to my new nutrition source, Generation UCAN (<a href=""http://www.generationucan.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.generationucan.com/', 'www.generationucan.com');"" title=""http://www.generationucan.com"">www.generationucan.com</a>), which I do affectionately call “NITRO” now. So far, so good; I had not throw up or even felt sick once. Amazing! I think poor Jeff is going to turn into a UCAN after making so much of it last weekend.</p>
<p>I thought, “Mer, please get back safely in this last twenty miles so you can start tomorrow on your feet! Yeah! Tomorrow you get to run—you are on your legs for the first time.”</p>
<p>Now that the race is over, I see how incredible that is. I was already on to the next day. I wasn’t worried about running; I was EXCITED to run. My mindset was not negative about the third day—it was pure acceptance.  I suppose that all the mental preparation paid off. It felt just like the end of an Ironman bike where I start to get my head together for the next leg. Every time I hit mile 90 of an Ironman bike, I start to think about the joy and safety of being on my feet. This was no different—other than the bike leg had been 16 hours and 25 minutes in two days.</p>
<p>With three stops for nature breaks, and two for mechanical issues, my bike time for Day 2 was 10:45 and moved me up the ladder a bit more. I was happy with this, and had a blast. The legs were feeling good. The crew took great care of me once again and were organized beyond belief. Thanks so much to Mike Danenberg of Performance Therapy (<a href=""http://www.performance-therapy.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.performance-therapy.com/', 'www.performance-therapy.com');"" title=""http://www.performance-therapy.com"">www.performance-therapy.com</a>) who came along and each night cured what ailed me using A.R.T. and massage so that I felt good as new in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3: 52.4-mile run (84.3k)</strong></p>
<p>Another one of the things I was most afraid of with Ultraman was waking up three days in a row for such an early start after so much activity the day prior. Suffice it to say that I am not a “morning person.” I’ve done American Triple T, which is sort of like Ultraman on a much smaller scale—several early mornings and a crazy amount of activity. I remember being exhausted by the third day simply trying to wake up! The evening of Day 1, I made too many phone calls and texts, etc., and ended up not getting into bed until 10:30pm. Big mistake considering our starts were at 6am. So, the evening of Day 2, I was ready for bed and in my room by 8:45pm. This paid dividends as Simon had moved the final start to 7am. I got 8.5 hours of sleep. For me, this is almost two nights worth at home!</p>
<p>I woke up before my alarm and did what most of us have done when and if we have to test our legs following a hard workout: got out of bed and lifted one leg at a time to see where they stood. Hmmm…so far, so good. I thought things were firing on all cylinders. So I hobbled downstairs for my pre-race breakfast of two UCAN shakes and checked the weather. Uh-oh. Crap! More rain and lots of wind. I had to get my head wrapped around running in that for however long this was going to take, I’m not going to lie to you. Three days of this starts to wear on you. Ugh.</p>
<p>Justin and I had a pacing talk before we left that was sort of hilarious because he was trying to psych me up to go under ten hours. He didn’t know that I had a goal of under nine hours. With something like this, you almost don’t want to vocalize a crazy goal like that for the third day, but I said something like, “I have no interest in running a 9:52, Justin.” I would have to run two sub 4:30 marathons back-to-back in order to achieve MY goal—over four mountain ranges—in unspeakable weather conditions. Not to mention, I don’t have much experience running hills. On this course, that could be a real problem! The entire first 18 or so miles is pretty much uphill. Then the some downhill, some flats, some rollers and BLAM! Oh, my. What the heck are we going up now?</p>
<p>I knew from the start that I felt pretty good. It was pouring down rain, and I had the right gear on. My <a href=""http://www.cep-sports.com"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cep-sports.com', 'CEP Compression');"">CEP Compression</a> run shorts and socks were the perfect choice in this type of weather, and they were helping my legs feel solid. The shorts did a good job of whisking water away, and I wasn’t chafing. I had on my<a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com""> Newton</a> trail shoes, also, which are weather resistant. From around the third mile, I started running with a guy named Enrique (Ki-ke) from Mallorca, and we stuck together the entire time. In ultra running, it is amazing how much this can help. Our crews became buddies, and we all started working together. Ki-ke and I shared the wind up some terrible terrain between miles 8-19 because it was howling up to 50mph with the rain pouring down sideways. Never, ever have I run in anything like those conditions—not to mention UP something like that in those conditions! It helped to commiserate with someone. At the halfway point, I changed my clothes and Newtons in order to stay warm. I’ve been in this situation before, and once I get cold, I am screwed. Even though it took me a little time, it was an important step for me. This was my only stop. The boys put my shoes on the defroster to dry them, and I changed those one more time but this only took a second. It is amazing how much this helps. Remember to do this if you run an ultra in bad conditions and start to get cold.</p>
<p>From miles 40-43, we ascended something unlike anything I have ever gone up on foot. I refused to stop running or to walk simply because I was so curious to see if I could do it, and I didn’t want to lose Ki-ke! I pretended like there was a tether between his back and my front, and I wouldn’t let him get more than 15-feet in front of me. The grade continued from 15-18% that entire time. I definitely could not talk to the crew. At one point, Jeff tried to give me a UCAN and thought something was seriously wrong with me because I was muttering under my breath over and over.</p>
<blockquote><p>Justin said, “Oh, no, dude. She’s counting.”</p>
<p>Jeff said, “What? Why? I don’t understand.” Mike was equally confused.</p>
<p>“She counts in order to keep her cadence up and get her mind off of the pain. She can’t even see you right now—totally out of it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Once we got to the top of the big climb (see photo to the left), it was the most amazing fairy tale view I have ever seen. Ki-ke and I knew we were almost home. We started speeding up, and kept that cadence until the end. We made one final turn onto the main highway that would eventually lead us into town, and ran the last 10k pretty fast. During this time, we decided that we wanted to finish together with our crews on either side, and this was very special. This is what Ultraman is about, and made the race for me. He had his flag, I had my flag, our crews were with us and we were all holding hands. What an incredible day.</p>
<p>Little did we know, but we had pushed so hard in the final 10k that we had made another pass and were gaining fast on three other people. They finished between eight and five minutes in front of us—they were right there! But, there was nothing we could do in the end, and it was a perfect end to the most fun I’ve ever had racing. My run time was 8:57—almost an hour faster than Justin told me to run.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>
<p>I feel compelled to make a short section on nutrition since I am known for throwing up in races. Already, I have had multiple people ask me if I puked my way through Ultraman. I am happy to say the answer is NO! In fact, I did not throw up even once—nor did I feel nauseous at all. Finally, I have found an answer to my nutritional needs in Generation UCAN. I fueled solely with UCAN and water (even for breakfast), plus a couple peanut butter crackers and Honey Stinger chews mid-way through the bike on Day 2. On Day 3, Jeff put a half scoop of First Endurance Pre-Race into my UCAN post Mile 40. That is it. And I never bonked. I finished each day with energy left in the tank. It really is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Generation UCAN and Coach Bob Seebohar of Fuel4Mance for working with me to prepare me for this event. He totally changed my nutrition outside of race day in order to make me more metabolically efficient, and I needed less than 80 calories per hour for this race. Considering I was in excess of 250 before working with him, and throwing up an average of six times a race, this is purely a miracle. He only had two months to do this. I am nothing short of amazed because I did not think it could be done; but I was willing to try absolutely anything.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>All in all, my total time was 29:04.49 with a 3:25 10k (6.2-mile) swim, 15-minute transition, 16:25 on the bike for 261.4-miles, and 8:57 for 52.4-miles on the run. There were 29 starters, 22 finishers (25% DNF rate among ultra and Ironman veterans—trust me, it was hard). I was the 2nd female, and 14th overall—plus the 2nd American out of five. Congratulations to everyone who took part—crew and athletes! Prior to the event, I had a sub-30 hour time goal after looking at the times of the other two Ultraman events in the world, and factoring in that this would be my first and unchartered territory. I didn’t think this would be a problem, and I thought I could go faster than that. However, I don’t think anyone expected this one to be quite as hard as it actually was. It took the cake, as they say, and will set the bar for Ultraman events to come. My only regret is that I wasn’t able to drop those extra five minutes and achieve a 28 handle. I was so close!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this novel that is my Ultraman UK race report. I hope you enjoyed it, and I’m sorry that it is so long. It was an interminable three days that seemed to fly. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to email me. If you read this and I raced with you in the UK, it was a pleasure and I hope to see you all again.</p>

				<p><em>Continuing our series for 60 Days of Better, Robbie tries to get to the bottom of his recently found love of running.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is something beautiful about running.  I can’t quite put my finger on it.  Maybe…</p>
<p>…it’s knowing that I am doing something that very few people can.  I don’t know a lot of people that can run 10 miles (like I did this past weekend).  When I was done I felt like Rocky at the top of the stairs in Philly, I had the Eye of the Tiger, I couldn’t be beat!  This attitude spills into other areas of my life.  Running makes me want to tackle my dreams.  Running makes me feel alive.  Running is empowering.</p>
<p>…it’s knowing that people are driving by me while I am running and I am making them think about their own life.  I wonder, are they thinking, “Hey, there’s a fat guy who is just running!  Maybe I can run and my life could be better”.  Running is inspiring.</p>
<p>…it’s the minutes or hours that I get to spend by myself while on a run, just me and my thoughts.  I can think about who I am and who I want to be.  I can make decisions and set goals.   I can think about difficult conversations that I need to have with people.  And thinking about important things in life while your body is producing those good endorphins during running helps you make really positive decisions.  Running brings clarity.</p>
<p>…it’s crossing paths with other runners also in the middle of their run.  There’s a moment of camaraderie when two people run past each other and there is that second of eye contact when both of us acknowledge to each other, “Yeah, we are getting it done!”  Or, when the obviously more seasoned runner gives the fat guy runner a high five and an immense amount of confidence (which happened to me during one of my first road runs), running brings people together.</p>
<p>…it’s giving me something to work for.  I signed up for a 5k race earlier this year.  I had never run that far before, but I paid my money and I was going to do it if it killed me (when you’ve never run before, you think running 3.1 miles will kill you! lol).  I ran it.  After I got over my injury, I knew what I wanted to do, so I paid for the 2013 Shamrock Marathon in Virginia Beach.  No, I hadn’t run a half marathon yet, but a half was not my goal.  I will obviously run a half while I am training for the full marathon, but I will run the Shamrock next year.  I am already on pace to run a half marathon race this November.  Who knows what I will do after those races, maybe Ironman?!  Running gives me something to work for.</p>
<p>…it’s the fact that running hurts so good!  After a long training run, usually a PR, I head straight for an ice bath which is not an easy thing to endure (but totally worth it!).  I know that for the rest of the day my legs are going to be stiff and sore.  After a night’s rest, the next day soreness wears off and I will feel good, ready to tackle the road again, and after a few runs, an even longer distance or speed.  Running makes me stronger.</p>
<p>…it’s that fact that running is a great outlet.  I can recall a few times where I went running just to get away.  Maybe I was frustrated about something or maybe I was really struggling with food cravings.  Running is a great place to just vent and release your stress and frustration that living in this crazy world can bring.  Running makes me calm.</p>
<p>…it’s the fact that running can be hard.  It’s difficult to start running.  I was way out of shape and had no idea how to run which led to injuries and frustration.  Sticking with it and figuring it out has led me to great personal victories.  There’s something about failing at something, but sticking with it long enough to finally beat it.  Running builds character.</p>
<p>Maybe…what makes running beautiful is a collection of all these things.  I hear a lot of people refer to running as a chore and I just don’t get it.  Running has become so much more than a means to an end for me.  Running tells me who I am and that there is a lot of life left to live.  So, for me, running is a beautiful thing.</p>

				<p>Dr. Shawn Allen of The Gait Guys discusses this gait problem in running form. The Cross-over gait is a product of gluteus medius and abdominal weakness and leaves the runner with much frontal plane hip movement, very little separation of the knees and a “cross over” of the feet, rendering a near “tight rope” running appearance where the feet seem to land on a straight line path. In the Part 2 video below, Dr. Allen will discuss a more detailed specific method to fix this. You will see this problem in well over 50% of runners. This problem leads to injury at the hip, knee and foot levels quite frequently.</p>

				<p>Welcome to a new series on The Running Front (TRF), Running in Tech (RIT)! This series will highlight…well…running in the world of technology. We realize that this is a really broad topic and we like it that way. We see examples of running mechanics and run training as well as the things they affect and the things affected by them all the time. Whether it’s video of a <a href=""http://youtu.be/sv35ItWLBBk"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://youtu.be/sv35ItWLBBk', 'robot running');"" title=""robot running"" target=""_blank"">robot running</a>, a smartphone app, a <a href=""http://dailymile.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://dailymile.com/', 'training website');"" title=""training website"" target=""_blank"">training website</a> or anything in between! Sometimes it may be about things that are more general to fitness and sometimes you may think that we’re reaching to tie a topic into running, but that’s ok.

To many of you his name and website will be very familiar to you but to those of you who are hearing about him for the first time, it’s time to become familiar with him!</p>
<p>DC Rainmaker is the website of über-blogger, Ray Maker. Ray began his journey to blogging by way of entering his first half-Iron distance race (<a href=""http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2007/09/big-kahuna-703-half-iron-race-report.html"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2007/09/big-kahuna-703-half-iron-race-report.html', 'The Big Kahuna');"" title=""The Big Kahuna"" target=""_blank"">The Big Kahuna</a>). Along the way, Ray managed to drop 60 pounds and take his background in tech and turn it into some of the best and most comprehensive product reviews available.</p>
<p>His reviews range from training computers and watches to power meters to scales to bike trainers to heart rate monitors to a bunch of stuff you probably never even knew existed! The reviews on DC Rainmaker are all the result of well thought out and methodical testing by Ray and each step is documented with incredible diligence. From firsthand experience I (Brandon) can tell you that on many occasions I’ve found myself on Ray’s site rather than a given manufaturer’s site to find the proper answers to my questions.<img id=""img-1357330600938"" class=""alignRight"" style=""float: right;"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/img_70051-resized-6001.png"" alt=""DC Rainmaker"" width=""282"" height=""126"" border=""0""></p>
<p>Since there is FAR too much amazing content on DC Rainmaker to point out one single item, we’re just going to point you to the site itself (below). Ray is currently living in Paris (for work) with his wife, testing cupcakes from his wife’s bakery right alongside powermeters and calorie counters. He writes a weekly column for <a href=""http://slowtwitch.com"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://slowtwitch.com', 'Slowtwitch');"" title=""Slowtwitch"" target=""_blank"">Slowtwitch</a> and can also be found in the pages of <a href=""http://www.bicycling.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bicycling.com/', 'Bicycling Magazine');"" title=""Bicycling Magazine"" target=""_blank"">Bicycling Magazine</a>.</p>

				<p>Having good stability is a critical requirement for all runners. Each time your body moves over your foot (called mid-stance in the gait cycle) you are loading two to three times your body weight on your foot and a little less at each successive body part up the bio-mechnical chain – ankle, shin, knee, thigh, hip, etc.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-01-16-at-8.44.17-AM-resized-600.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-3915"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-01-16-at-8.44.17-AM-resized-600-199x300.png"" alt=""Ian Adamson talks Stability in Running"" width=""199"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-01-16-at-8.44.17-AM-resized-600-199x300.png 199w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-01-16-at-8.44.17-AM-resized-600.png 600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px""></a>In mid-stance, all this force is on one leg, so you need to have good stability in order to do it safely and efficiently. If you are unable to balance on one leg with all this load, you can’t run. Put simply you will fall over. Runners with poor balance tend to rock side to side since they place their feet in a wide stance.</p>
<p>Stability is not just about balance, since muscular strength is required. Try this exercise to demonstrate:</p>
<p>1. Stand on one leg in front of a full length mirror</p>
<p>2. Keeping your foot flat to the ground, do a shallow squat by flexing your knee hip and ankle as far as possible</p>
<p>3. Make sure your body stays upright (don’t bend forward at the waist)</p>
<p>4. Slowly return to an upright position and keep repeating for as long as you can on two second cycles (one second down, one second up)</p>
<p>This is essential what you are doing (in the vertical axis) while running, but with about one body weight. Imagine doing this with two and a half. Most likely your leg will get tired and you will have to stop due to muscular fatigue.</p>
<p>Now do a few more repetitions and look a little more closely at your alignment (and consequently your stability.) Is your knee tracking straight and true? If not, this is almost certainly happening when you run. As a result, the misalignment at your knee will cause excess stress, which with repetition and load (that would be running) can cause pain and ultimately injury. Typical inures from knee misalignment include medial or lateral knee pain, ITB syndrome and medial shin splints (extrinsic muscles controlling the foot trying to compensate), plus a host more.</p>
<p>The solution is not obvious for most runners.</p>
<p>1. Choose a shoe that is not thick and soft so the surface under your foot is stable. Any shoe that relies on midsole foam for cushioning and is more than about 6 mm thick is probably not good. Soft foams are also unstable, the thicker and softer the worse it gets. Newton shoes do not rely on midsole foam and are essentially hard runner once you load them in a running gait. Newton Running offers two stability models: <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-kismet-ii"">Men’s Kismet</a>, <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/womens-kismet-ii"">Women’s Kismet</a> and <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-motion-v-b"">Men’s Motion</a> and <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/women-motion-v-b"">Women’s Motion</a>.</p>
<p>2. Stabilize your leg to control the motion at the knee. The knee is a stable joint (like a hinge) and is controlled at either end. The primary muscle controlling the femur (thigh) in the stance phase of gait is the Gluteus Medius, the big muscle on your butt to the outside. This muscle stops your hip dropping and keeps your knee aligned side to side.</p>
<p>A good strength exercise for leg stability is the single leg shallow squat described above. This can be done while brushing your teeth (you do this anyway right?), with a goal of doing 30 repetitions each leg (two seconds per rep.) You have to do these exercises with precision, otherwise your are practicing poor form and will get good at doing these badly! For some people, this may only be two or three repetitions the first time until failure. Failure is when you loose control of your leg, for example knee doesn’t track straight, your hip drops, rises or you loos balance. Don’t worry, progress can be quite fast so after a few weeks you should be able to do this easily.</p>

				<p>There is a lot of confusion around the term elastic recoil vs. braking in running.  A critical feature of efficient running is a strong and stable base of support.  Without this foundation, there can be no efficient transfer of energy.</p>
<p><img class=""alignLeft"" id=""img-1359411552489"" style=""float: left;"" alt=""Screen shot 2012 11 12 at 4.21.14 PM resized 600"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2012-11-12-at-4.21.14-PM-resized-6001.png"" width=""247"" height=""162"" border=""0"">Our tendons are highly adapted to storing and releasing energy under tensile strain.  Jay Dicharry uses  a slingshot analogy.  As runners we must land a bit in front of our center of mass to store the energy and it then releases as we push off the ground.  This is <span>not</span> braking if done correctly.</p>
<p>Can we tell what the runner is actually doing with a video camera?  Not exactly, as we cannot see forces?</p>
<p>But we can make some likely conclusions with slow-motion film as one can see a springy motion vs. a hard hit and resulting shock wave with an overstride.  Muscles lengthen and shorten in the overstride and slow cadence pattern and compromise the elastic storage, as does trying to pick up your foot too soon with active muscle contraction (this is sprinting).</p>
<p>Rewatch this video on the “Principles of Natural Running” below. Do some of the drills shown in the video such as the jump rope and run with tether drill to learn how to land closer to your center.

				<p class=""p1"">Runners often exhibit form habits that can be attributed to  prior injuries, limited range of motion, and movement patterns. This generally results from years of sitting, standing and running with less than optimal alignment and running form.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Moving at a slow cadence and with sub-optimal movement patterns often results  in inefficiencies and, in some cases may lead to injury. Many runners strive to improve their running efficiency, to improve running speed or seek to have less wear and tear to the body. In the context of the above traits, some things can be improved on and other traits cannot. The goal would to be the most efficient runner YOU can be.</p>
<p class=""p1"">More parallel foot placement to the ground is going to be more efficient than a straight leg heel first landing. This is because the lower legs and feet are in a poor position to help attenuate impact and utilize the spring in the leg and foot muscles.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Slight heel landing with flexed knee is more efficient than landing with locked knee and extended heel strike. In a full foot / whole foot / midfoot landing the runner should feel the entire foot touch the ground at the same time. This means you will feel the heel touch with the rest of the foot. A midfoot strike should be more efficient than heel first because the foot and body can get in and out of maximum loading quicker. Maximum load occurs in mid-stance phase during a running gait and this is where the foot/ankle is stable and locked. The ankle and knee are flexed and the muscle/tendon complex is re-coiling like a spring.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A midfoot landing is relatively safe and efficient, but to maximize the benefits, you should have sufficient range of motion. This includes ankle dorsiflexion where the foot is raised upward. If you have past injuries of the ankle with limited dorsiflexion and over tightness in the calf muscles, a midfoot landing might be difficult to achieve..</p>
<p class=""p1"">Landing slightly on your forefoot and letting your heel relax to the ground is a very efficient foot strike and works well for faster and more efficient runners. Again, do you have the individual traits that allow you to land the way you choose or do you have some restrictions and limitations?</p>
<p class=""p1"">The mind and body connection, agility and coordinated whole body movement that comes from running form drills, an efficient cadence, core strength, core movement and relaxed foot placement can help runners become more efficient. Remember a good goal is to be the most efficient runner YOU can be to enjoy a lifetime of fun and fitness. </p>

See, my mom was a true flower child and my dad was as free and easy as the Colorado winds… OK we were hippies and dad played drums in a band. Yep that’s me in the sweet pants around Christmas.</p>
<p>We settled down in Raleigh, NC and that’s where I spent most of my youth.  I grew up playing soccer, surfing and swimming. Soccer was my favorite and I ultimately went to college to play. After college, a season ski bumming in Killington and then some more college; I followed my Dad’s footsteps and went into the restaurant/bar industry.  Eventually my wife and I became owners in the industry for over eight years. We had a blast and it was a huge success, but horrible on the midline!</p>
<p>Five years into the biz…. I saw a picture of myself (that I will not share). With the thoughts of<a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tor-Broder-resized-600.png""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-3899"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tor-Broder-resized-600-223x300.png"" alt=""Tor Broder-resized-600"" width=""223"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tor-Broder-resized-600-223x300.png 223w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tor-Broder-resized-600.png 600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px""></a> having children it was time to make a change. Our ultimate goal was to lead by example and show our kids a healthy way to live. A little time and several pounds later…. It worked! That’s my son Broder and I training for his first 5K.</p>
<p>During that time I had been fulfilling a love for competition with triathlon. This is where  the running comes in… soccer players only run when told. Swimming came naturally, cycling is awesome but running? Ugh. But even not being a runner by trade, it wasn’t long before I developed a passion for the trails and longing to tick off the miles. Running became my favorite discipline.</p>
<p>On a visit to a local triathlon shop I happened to try on a pair of Newtons. They felt amazing  and despite receiving discounted shoes from another brand, I purchased a pair. Not only did they feel great but that end of the season IT band ache disappeared. Needless to say it’s the only shoe I have worn since!</p>
<p>In July 2011 I was able to marry my lifestyle passion with an opportunity at <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a>.  As Regional Sales Manager of the Mid-Atlantic I’m able to surround myself with incredibly passionate people and continue to feed that competitive drive.</p>
<p>Many thanks to my wife Carolyn, Lilla and Broder</p>

<p>Let’s see now, the African subjects were running barefoot; but people land in different ways, and as you speed up you get more forward on your foot. Not surprising as anyone who runs, coaches, researches, or even observes runners knows .  There was absolutely no reference or relevance to injuries or footwear effects in this study. These happy tribesman were jogging slowly in their bare feet as they do daily, and I doubt any of them had or ever will have running injuries.</p>
<p>They were active tribal people (not habitual runners) running at a jogging pace.</p>
<p>This study reinforces what many of us in the Running Medicine field have been voicing for a long time. People are focusing on one variable and most often it is footwear or what part of your foot hits the ground first,  and ignoring the other 90% of the equation.</p>
<p>Runners get hurt by running.  Most often by running  too much, too fast, and often with poor strength and movement mechanics. Humans are also highly variable and it is doubtful any of us does or should land in the same way every time, on every surface , and at every speed.</p>
<p>No one of credibility in the professional field is telling runners to land on their forefoot or ball of foot in isolation, nor suggesting  for folks to chuck their shoes.  What is interesting in studies is they rarely agree on what a forefoot or midfoot strike actually is.  A true forefoot strike is probably along the base of the 5th metatarsal (outside edge of foot), not the ball of the foot or metatarsal heads.</p>
<p>As an often barefoot runner I land different on different surfaces at different speeds. On soft golf courses and easy pace, I roll nicely from the heel.  Running fast on concrete, I need to engage the foot more as shock absorber and to prestretch the takeoff muscle contraction.</p>
<p>Remember the key is running elastic– landing close to your center of mass, and engaging the posterior muscles (glutes).</p>
<p>I still stand behind what we filmed here as the <a href=""http://naturalrunningcenter.com/2013/01/06/video-the-principles-natural-running/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://naturalrunningcenter.com/2013/01/06/video-the-principles-natural-running/', 'Principles of Natural Running.');"">Principles of Natural Running.</a> Not where do we say that runners should aim to land on the ball of the foot.</p>
<p>Running barefoot in itself will not change most of the other variables contributing to poor form and injury, but it does have a role in the relearning process.</p>
<p>See ou<a href=""http://naturalrunningcenter.com/category/strength-mobility/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://naturalrunningcenter.com/category/strength-mobility/', 'r Stability and Mobility section on the Natural Running Center');"">r Stability and Mobility section on the Natural Running Center</a>, and notice where the real improvements occur and do lots of progressive drills to rewire the movement pattern.</p>
<p>Another finding reinforcing what we know is that as the runners ran faster, they landed on their forefoot more often. This is normal and necessary.</p>
<p>Everyone’s form changes when they go from 9:00 per mile to 5:00 per mile. As one moves faster it is efficient to eccentrically stretch the triceps surae the load the Achilles spring. This is like jumping: .load, trigger, fire.</p>
<p>Instructing an 9:00 mile runner  to  emulate the 5:00 mile biomechanics is short sighted and one should not suggest it.</p>
<p>My personal take-home messages from this recent study of African tribesman and the “barefoot” attention that resulted from it is as follows:</p>
<p>•    Do not focus on footstrike in isolation<br>
•    Gradually increase cadence<br>
•    Mix it up….surfaces, shoes, barefoot,<br>
•    Use your glutes and extend the hips from a stable core<br>
•    Watching a barefoot runner land on their heel does not mean that we were <em>not</em> born to run barefoot or that shoes need a cushioned heel.<br>
•    Have fun!</p>

<p>Jon and Burke Beck have both been running since high school. They ran Division 3 in college and worked in running stores after they graduated—Burke, near Washington, DC and Jon, in Rochester, New York. The two met, in San Diego, where Jon relocated to work for a larger running company and Burke had moved to work at another running store. From San Diego, they moved to Portland, where they continued to work in the industry. Together, the young couple talked about someday owning their own running store. Maybe when they retired. They didn’t imagine it would happen now, let alone in Burke’s hometown of Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>“Burke always said she would never move back after she left for college,” says Jon. But when the couple headed back for a quick weekend trip to see family, they visited a local running store and were disappointed in the quality of service and running expertise. The seed was planted. “Burke’s dad said ‘it’s a great time to open a business in Oklahoma City,’” explains Jon, and the seed was watered.</p>
<p>But it was true. A lot of companies, were moving headquarters to Oklahoma City and there was a new demographic of young professionals in the city.  By the end of their weekend visit, the couple had checked out the local competition, picked out possible store locations and said, “Let’s do it.” Soon after, they lined up funding. In August of 2009, they moved back to Oklahoma. In March of 2010, they opened their store, Red Coyote Running and Fitness (named after their dog “Pancho,” who happens to look like a red coyote).</p>
<p>Seeking innovative products that matched their focus on quality, Red Coyote became the first to offer Newton in Oklahoma City, a feat they’re proud of. “I was running at the lake and I saw 15 people running, five were wearing Newton shoes. It makes me smile because we opened Newton here, and we’re the ones who sell it,” says Burke. But the couple credits Newton for laying the groundwork. “When we had our grand opening, Newton was the only brand that came out for it, which showed us their commitment. Timmy came and he took customers out for runs in the shoes.” She adds, “When we opened, people hadn’t heard about them. But we’ve had staff on board from the beginning and bringing them out to customers. They’re not just for elite runners. You can bring them out for anyone.</p>
<p>“I think word of mouth helped us grow the brand. People have such a different experience in <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton’s</a>, they really love it and they tell their friends, ‘you’ve got to try these shoes.’ It’s been an easy sell for us.”</p>
<p>The “easy” part is matched by the effort and passion the Becks bring to their store and the running community. It’s been a busy three years. Aside from opening the store in March 2010, they were married in May of 2010 and had a son in March of 2013. At the end of March, they moved into an expanded new location. Looking back on the whirlwind of the past three years, Jon says, “Oklahoma was very under-served or untapped. There were a lot of people running. We have one of the biggest marathons in April every year, but there weren’t a lot of events and groups or opportunities to get together to have a fun run.” Furthermore, no one was doing learn to run or training groups.</p>
<p>Jon and Burke began to sponsor events as well as host training groups at the store. “We started the newbie program and that has just taken over. First, it was 50 people twice a year, now it’s over 200 and it’s a 10-week program. It’s booming. All of our groups are growing and we’re seeing other training groups and social groups spawning from that.” Their Pack Pint Runs—a run followed by beer—every Thursday night are also popular.</p>
<p>Burke adds, “Oklahoma doesn’t have a very developed elite running community, but there are a lot of new runners and people just getting into the sport and the community is really organizing. I would attribute it to that younger professional group looking for something to do. And now, we’re getting family and kids, too.”</p>
<p>The store’s fast-growing popularity has not gone unnoticed. <i>Outside </i>magazine wrote about the Thursday night run and <i>Competitor </i>magazine named the Red Coyote one of The Best 50 Stores in the US (an honor considering the magazine rigorously evaluates 1,000 running stores). It also was nominated by <i>Competitor </i>with three other stores for Best Running Store of the Year, and was the youngest store ever to be nominated for this accolade.</p>
<p>Of the community support, Jon says, “We have been surprised by how much the community has come out to support us in only 3 years. The community rallied around us and what we’ve done to support them and they have come to support us.” Burke adds, “There was a niche to fill, but Oklahoma has a friendly group [in the running business], and from what we can tell, everyone is up. The growth that we have helped in the community has helped them as well.” Run on Oklahoma!</p>

				<p>With our new partnership with Ironman comes Newton Running’s position not only as the official shoe and run course of the granddaddy of triathlon but also writing a series of “Running Modules” for Ironman.com.</p>
<p>In this first installment, written by Newton’s Director or Research and Education Ian Adamson, we focus on probably the most important aspect of running and that is: efficiency. Too often we get hung up on working on biking technique, swimming technique, what shoe is right, what socks we’re wearing or whether the ratio of compression garments to sweat rate is in some arbitrary sweet spot. When you strip away all that other stuff, the one thing that we consistently overlook is running technique and efficiency.</p>
<p>In this piece, Ian gets into some of the most basic yet most often ignored information of running efficiency and the role it plays, and has always played, in our lives.</p>

				<h1>“Our company was founded on the principle of helping others. It starts with our commitment to our community and continues with our involvement with a diverse range of philanthropic organizations both here and abroad.”</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Is this a running company? Yes, it is. And, yes, this is what’s written at the top of Newton’s Global Responsibility page. “It’s my dad,” explains Wendy Lee, whose dad, Jerry Lee, is CEO and cofounded Newton Running together with Danny Abshire, CTO. “Honestly, when he founded the company with Danny, he was at a point where he had been very successful in his previous career. He said, ‘If I’m going to start another company, and particularly a running shoe company, the reason I’m doing it is to help other people.’ It starts with him and he made the philosophy from the beginning and made it understood.” Lee, who is Director of Global Sustainability and oversees Newton’s initiatives in this arena, adds, “Of course, we want to make the best running shoe and provide the best running education, but at the end of the day we want to help the lives of other people.”</p>
<p>And this isn’t just a Jerry and Danny thing. Employees hear about social responsibility in their initial interviews and are introduced to it in the orientation process. It’s also written into job descriptions. “Every employee needs to be involved with social responsibility to whatever level possible. Everyone knows that’s what we stand for and that’s why we exist.  It’s not just something we do on the side, this is why we exist and I find that people really like it and get excited,” explains Lee.</p>
<p>So what exactly does all this talk mean?</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;""> Newton has supported the prostate cancer foundation for many years. Lee’s dad and founder, Jerry, is a prostate cancer survivor (since 2005), so she says, they feel strongly about that one. Newton Running also sponsors team athlete Winter Vinecki, who lost her dad to prostate cancer and races to raise funds to fight the disease.</span></p></li>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;""> Newton has always encouraged athletes to participate in triathlon, while raising funds for causes that hit close to home, such as prostate cancer. In 2013, Newton partnered with the Ironman Foundation to create an ambassador team of 45 athletes. This team of athletes not only raced, but they were charged with raising funds and participating in direct service projects to give back to designated non-profits in the communities in which they were racing. The team has raised $70,000 so far, and Lee is hoping they will break $100,000. Most recently, the team was in Arizona where they organized a track and field day at a school, and then presented a check to the school to go toward a PE program and physical fitness. Next year, Lee says she expects the team will have closer to 60 athletes.</span></p></li>

It is an organization that provides education, training and grants for some of the world’s poorest people to develop microenterprises. “It’s a small charity, but they do incredible work,” says Lee. “Trickle Up focuses on the extreme poor, who seem to be overlooked by other charities. They are left out because they are so isolated and impoverished. They live on under $1.50 a day. There are a lot of people, especially women with children living under this poverty line. The quality of life is very low.” </span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"">Trickle Up works with local organizations to help train these women how to start their own businesses, usually in textiles or farming. They help these women to establish their own micro-economy and to have a sustainable economy for themselves, which then allows their kids to go to school and to get an education. Each season, Newton chooses a shoe from which a $1 per sale goes to the Trickle Up campaign.</span></p>

<p>Being a company that does the right thing also means that after Hurricane Sandy hit, Jerry Lee spontaneously gave 100s of pairs of running shoes that the company had brought to sell at the New York marathon expo to a group of firefighters who happened to be walking through the expo. They in turn donated the shoes to survivors of the hurricane.  Likewise, shoes have been sent to the Philippines and the company even helped their own community after the Colorado floods sent water gushing through Newton’s backyard this fall.  “We are always ready to help where we can,” says Lee. The company also gives a discount to military members.</p>
<p>Although Jerry Lee won’t toot his own horn, his daughter will, as will Newton employees who have witnessed the giving firsthand. Lee encourages others in the running community to do the same, to look around and see where there is a need. “If there’s any way to help, then do it. Be aware of what’s going on and get involved.” She adds, “We have so much to be thankful for, our health and our well being, particularly when you think about the flooding and the fires that have happened in our own backyard. We’re thankful as a company for our customers and their support of us. We have been fortunate and continue to be so as a company, so it’s our responsibility to give back. It’s what we do.”</p>

"<div class=""entry-content"" itemprop=""articleBody"">

			
				<h1>Sculptor Bob Zasadny makes a unique pair of Newtons</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>If you find yourself driving in western Kentucky any time soon, specifically in Madisonville, take a moment to drive by, or even run around the Baptist Health Madisonville Trover Wellness Park, which sits next to the Baptist Health Madisonville hospital campus. Here, you’ll find something that looks strangely familiar: a pair of Distance Newton running shoes. But these just aren’t any pair of Distance shoes, this pair is four-feet long, roughly 20 inches high at the back and heel and about 20 inches wide—roughly four-times the average sized shoe.</p>
<p>The hospital commissioned Indianna artist, Bob Zasadny, to create the giant shoe sculpture as a tribute for outgoing CEO, Berton Whitaker.  Whitaker, is a runner, who actually runs in the Newton Distance. He also was responsible, amongst other things, for the creation of the Baptist Health Madisonville Trover Wellness Park, which has 10 different fitness stations and a half-mile walking or running trail. So, the real idea here, says Zasadny, is that Whitaker is leaving big shoes to fill.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe6.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-4699 alignleft"" alt=""shoe6"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe6.jpg"" width=""287"" height=""192"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe6.jpg 319w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe6-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px""></a> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7536.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-4693 alignright"" alt=""IMG_7536"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7536.jpg"" width=""287"" height=""192"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7536.jpg 319w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7536-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px""></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other surprising thing about these shoes is that they only weigh about 20 pounds each. Zasadny constructed them out of rigid polyurethane foam coated in fiberglass.  Zasadny worked at a fiberglass company in his early 20s and was always fascinated with the medium. Now, 50 years later he says, at the age of 75, he’s still working with fiberglass. “It’s an alternative material, but not a widely used thing because it’s a unique product. It’s not a pleasant material to work with and you have to be a bit technical to work with it.” But he says, “It was a perfect media for me because I could manipulate it because of my industrial experience with it. I knew how to fabricate it and I could find artistic ways to use it.”</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Shoes-1.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-4698 alignleft"" alt=""Shoes 1"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Shoes-1.jpg"" width=""287"" height=""192"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Shoes-1.jpg 319w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Shoes-1-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px""></a> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe5.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-4697 alignright"" alt=""shoe5"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe5.jpg"" width=""287"" height=""192"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe5.jpg 319w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe5-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px""></a></p>
<p>Typically, Zasadny likes to sculpt the forms we see in nature—sand dunes, leaf patterns, flower petals, things that are more organic. “I’ve tried to incorporate more natural things into my art. It resonates with people, they have to reach out and touch it and run their hands over it. It’s a tactile thing that you want to feel and start touching art with your hands.” But when the opportunity to create the Newtons came his way, he jumped on it. He hadn’t heard of Newton shoes prior to the project, but quickly found a pair to check out. “It was like walking on my socks and a piece of foam, such an airy feeling.” The colors weren’t lost on Zasadny either. He kept the shoes bright, but instead incorporated the four colors that matched the hospital logo.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe-2.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-4695 alignleft"" alt=""shoe 2"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe-2.jpg"" width=""287"" height=""192"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe-2.jpg 319w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe-2-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px""></a><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe4.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-4696 alignright"" alt=""shoe4"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe4.jpg"" width=""287"" height=""192"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe4.jpg 319w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/shoe4-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px""></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what does it take to complete a project like this? Zasadny says when all was said and done, including making the tabletops the shoes are mounted on, it took him “easily 400 hours. For 6 weeks, I worked 60-70 hour weeks. We were making something that had never been made before.” And with that much time invested, you would think he might be worried about the longevity of the sculpture. But, the ultimate beauty of working with the foam and fiberglass materials is that if the sculpture gets a ding in it or is damaged in any way, Zasadny says, “I can go down there and take some material, grind it up and make the damaged area totally like brand new. It’s not as tragic for that to be vandalized as it would be for someone else’s materials.” Long live Newtons!</p>

				<h1>An interview with trainer and nutritionist, Lindsay Christen</h1>
<p>As January came and went, so too went many of our New Year’s Resolutions, sometimes it’s hard to make our lofty goals (I’m going to run faster, eat healthier, drink less coffee) a habit overnight. So let’s press the reset button. We caught up with trainer and certified nutritionist, Lindsay Christen, to talk about changing habits and the most common nutrition question she gets asked.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/LindsayChristen1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter  wp-image-4741"" alt=""LindsayChristen1"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/LindsayChristen1.jpg"" width=""560"" height=""373"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/LindsayChristen1.jpg 800w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/LindsayChristen1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/LindsayChristen1-624x415.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px""></a></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  “What should I eat before or after a workout?” </b></p>
<p><b>Lindsay: </b>Eating the right foods at the right time is essential to getting the most out of your workouts. For pre-workout you always need a little bit of something in your body and you’ll feel better if it’s 45-minutes to an hour before your workout. The general idea is that you’re filling up your energy stores. If your meals the day and week before have been healthy and balanced your glycogen, the storage form of energy in your body, should be good. Those taps should be full, so you’re just topping-off the tank when you have a pre-workout snack—it doesn’t need to be large.</p>
<p>Right before a workout, a little bit of something like banana and almond butter, or non-fat Greek yogurt, or a couple of eggs are perfect, something small but enough to give the glycogen stores a boost.</p>
<p>The dinner the night before an event or big workout should be lots of lean protein, chicken or fish—vegetarians can eat beans, lentils, tofu—and lots of veggies and complex carbs (starchy veggies, whole grains, like rice, quinoa). That combination should give your body what it needs for the next day. For an endurance athlete, depending on what they’re training for, 45-65% of total calories should be from carbohydrates. It’s a big window and it’s on the higher end, but they need it for the workouts, otherwise you feel like you’re on an empty tank all the time.</p>
<p><b>What’s really important is the post workout snack.</b> The right combination of nutrients and timing can optimize your lean muscle building while minimizing breakdown (soreness and fatigue). But you only have a window of 30 minutes after exercise when the body is most efficiently absorbing much needed nutrients.  If you miss the window, your body will try to replenish on its own by depleting your fat and energy stores.</p>
<p><b>Newton:</b> What’s a good post-workout snack? Is there anything to chocolate milk?</p>
<p><b>Lindsay:</b> Chocolate milk is not terrible. It’s a good source as long as it’s the good kind and not filled with high fructose corn syrup. A protein smoothie is good. You’re looking for a 2-1 or 3-1 carb to protein ratio in grams. This equates to 1-1.5g of carbohydrate for every kg of your body weight and 0.5g or protein/kg of body weight. This could be a bar that you throw in your gym bag for the way home, peanut butter and apple or a peanut butter banana sandwich really works well, or fresh fruit, Greek yogurt, and a scoop of protein powder.</p>
<p>Now, if you just finished an Ironman, or marathon, you can eat whatever you want. You’re going to be depleted no matter what. You need to get nutrients in as soon as possible after the race, and then continually. Usually liquids work well, you want electrolytes, and then carbs and proteins.</p>
<p><b>Lindsay’s Caveat: </b>No matter what you do, start early. Incorporate these changes into your routine months and months beforehand. It’s not going to work for you if you start on race day. Eating well has to be a habit. You need to build your body into the machine you want it to be in race season. You also don’t want to add everything in at the same time. It’s February, so this is the perfect time to add things in if you have a race in June, July or August.  It’s about developing the right habits to weave into your lifestyle. It shouldn’t just be, “It’s race season, so I am going to stop eating hamburgers.” Our bodies are machines and the more quality fuel you can give it now, the more efficient it will be in performance when you need it.</p>

<p>These aren’t your ordinary race snacks, but then again Kara Henry isn’t your ordinary runner. One minute the 29-year-old is doing 6:20-minute pace in a half marathon, look again, and she easily falls into a 15-minute pace for the Leadville 100, where she placed 6<sup>th</sup> last summer in a time of 23:50 (four hours faster than her first attempt in 2012). But truth be told, 50-mile and 50K races hit her sweet spot. In 2012, she ran her first 50-miler, the Bear Chase 50, in Lakewood, Colorado. She not only won the women’s division, she set a course record. “That was a shock,” she says. But it also showed her (and others) what she was capable of.</p>
<p>Kara is the first to admit she has a competitive side. “I learned the hard way that I can’t do a race as a training run. I go into every race wanting to win whether I’ve trained or not.”</p>
<p>Growing up in Elmhurst, Illinois, Kara joined the cross-country team in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. She had never participated in competitive sports before and it wasn’t really the running that drew her to the team. Rather, it was the fact that her tough science teacher was the coach. She thought if she joined the cross-country team she could get in his good books and get a better grade. But that didn’t mean she came to practice ready to run, “I would show up at practices and walk and chat with my friends.” That was, until her very first cross-country race. “I couldn’t sleep the night before. All I could think about was winning the race.” And win she did. This set in motion a strong high school cross-country career that earned her multiple all-state honors and landed her a scholarship to Butler University.</p>
<p>After moving west after Butler, Kara notes, “running took a back seat to paying my bills for a few years.” But then, a friend convinced her to run the Quad Dipsea, a 28.4-mile annual trail run in Mill Valley, California, and surprise, surprise, that old competitive nature kicked in without hesitation. She placed second in the women’s race. “It’s a pretty prestigious race and no one knew who I was.” The ultra community would know who she was soon enough.</p>
<p>Shortly after that first race, Kara moved to Boulder, Colorado, in the Spring of 2012 to take a job as the marketing manager at Newton. Since she didn’t know anyone in town, she spent a lot of hours running the trails by her self. Then came the Bear Chase 50. “That first 50-miler was the best experience. It went so well for me. I think if it had gone poorly, I wouldn’t have kept on with the ultra thing.” It was at that race, where she realized what she was made of, “I had such a fun day and really learned to dig from the deepest depths of my own personal hell and get out of it. I learned when you think you can’t take another step, you can all of a sudden run 8-minute miles again.”</p>
<p>Although Kara knew she had great potential for the distance races, it hasn’t been totally smooth sailing.  “In 2012, I screwed up every week. One week I was vomiting, the next race I fell off a cliff, and I got lost. I am really bad with a sense of direction. Some people can look up and know where the car is, if you spin me around in downtown Boulder, I’ll get lost. If I’m not paying attention, I’ll go left, when I should have gone right.” Which is what she did when she went to Texas for the US 100K championships. She took a wrong turn and the next thing she knew, she was tumbling head over heels through cactus. “It’s a long way to travel to end up all bloody and in the car before the race was over.”</p>

<p>At Leadville in 2012, she entered simply with the hopes of finishing, which she did, but not without hallucinating and falling asleep while running in the wee hours of the morning. “It was about 4am or a bit later. I had been out there for 24 hours and the sun was about to come up again. It’s really rough watching the sun rise twice. My friend was pacing me and she was just super chatty, chatty and she would ask me something and 10 or 12 minutes later I’d say, ‘what?’ She realized I was falling asleep, so she started breaking up Honey Stinger bars and she would make me eat these bites of sugar every 15 minutes. It woke me up.”</p>
<p>2013 was a different story. She took a different tact: she trained. “I really focused on a training plan and on the races leading up to Leadville. I was good with nutrition, everything that could have gone well went well.” In other words, she won all of the 25-mile and 50-milers she entered, and garnered 6<sup>th</sup> at Leadville.</p>
<p>So now what? “I’m going to take a year off from running a 100 miler. I’ll do a few 50s. I’ve had this marathon monkey on my back for a couple of years. I’ve never really raced a marathon. I’d like to get one real crack at a marathon and call it a day.” That marathon will be the Twin Cities in October and then she’ll focus on Rocky Raccoon, the Trail Running 100-mile championship 100-mile in January, 2015 in Huntsville, Texas.</p>
<p>Oh and about that nutrition thing. She did focus on good nutrition while training last year, but seems like anything goes in a race. Kara’s secret weapons are in fact gummy bears—she ate 5 packs of them in Leadville—“a lot of pretzels, some bacon…and cold frozen pizza is this excellent running food, too.” And that 8<sup>th</sup> grade science class? She got an A.</p>

				<h1></h1>
<p>Every New Year’s Eve, Stephanie Blozy and her sister set goals. In 2005, with both of them looking for a change, they agreed they should go into business together. Next, they considered what kind of business. “We listed our passions, and we only had 2: chocolate and running. We liked to bake, but it never looked good, so we decided we should open a running store,” Blozy explains. And they were serious.</p>
<p>Three-and-a-half years later, the sisters took over Fleet Feet Sports in West Hartford, Connecticut (coincidentally located just a mile and a half from their parents’ home). “The world still doesn’t think women are the most capable business people for one reason or another. We wanted to show them that 2 sisters could do this.” They’ve never looked back. Blozy is the extrovert, who loves mingling with customers. Her sister runs the backend of the business and their dad, who is 67, runs the kids’ program.</p>
<p>Blozy’s dad has run 30 marathons, including Boston every decade since his 20s, her sister 12, and Blozy has now run 7. “But I have done a 50K, so I’ve topped them all.” And that competitive nature is what brought Blozy to Newton.</p>
<p>Blozy admits she was initially skeptical about Newtons and the benefits of the lug system.  But then, Blozy put a woman in her beginner program in a pair. She returned to the store raving about the shoes and talking about how she was running 2 minutes a mile faster in them. Then a family friend came into the store talking about how he was faster in these shoes.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/StephCarrie_0892.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4766"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/StephCarrie_0892-1024x592.jpg"" alt=""StephCarrie_0892"" width=""625"" height=""361"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/StephCarrie_0892-1024x592.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/StephCarrie_0892-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/StephCarrie_0892-624x360.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p>“My sister and I are pretty competitive. We were going to run the Las Vegas Rock ‘n’ Roll marathon. I needed any advantage I could get,” she says. She started running in Newtons. But much to Blozy’s chagrin, her sister caught wind of how well Newtons were working for Blozy, and changed, too. “She beat me by 30 seconds.” Now her dad is running in them, too. “The <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton shoes</a> make you so much more efficient in the turnover/gait cycle,” she enthuses.</p>
<p>As Blozy continues to see customers have success with the shoes, she says, “I think Newton puts the special in run specialty. As a specialty store, we’re always trying to differentiate. To be able to offer a solution like Newton, when it’s appropriate and works for them, it’s an amazing thing.”</p>
<p>Seems like Blozy and her sister have also put the special back in specialty with the community they have created around the store. After the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, they collected shoes for survivors. “We were hoping to donate a couple hundred pairs of shoes. We ended up with 20,000 shoes.” Then, more than 100 people showed up to help match shoes and load the truck. And after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the store put together more than 100 care packages for families. Last spring, more than 500 participants showed up for their run for Boston.</p>
<p>To boot, their kids program has a robust offering for kids with autism and every four years they give out a college scholarship to a local high school runner. They do it every four years, so they can support a student through college, not just for one year. In all of this, they expanded the store from 1500 square feet to 3500.</p>
<p>Who knows what’s next. If they set out to show the world two sisters could do it, they have.</p>

				<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center""><em>by: Alex Weber</em></p>
<p>I chose to race <a href=""http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/ironman/texas.aspx#axzz2RD0elv00"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/ironman/texas.aspx#axzz2RD0elv00', 'Ironman Texas');"" title=""Ironman Texas"" target=""_blank"">Ironman Texas</a>, first and foremost, because I wanted my first ironman race to be in my home state of Texas.  I get sentimental with races sometimes and felt like I wanted this accomplishment to be close to home.  The course had a reputation for being flat and spectator friendly, which I was also really excited about!  If you are from Texas, or anywhere in the south, it is especially easy to travel to the race and there are lots of options for hotels and restaurants nearby.  Even if you are from out of town, IAH international airport is only about 30 minutes away from the race venue. This race is a great excuse for out of town athletes to experience Texas and all the state has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Check In</strong></p>
<p>Check in for the race was very organized with lots of volunteers.  Everything was clearly labeled and explained, which a relief was since this was my first 140.6. The race packets also had lots of great “goodies” inside.  Keep in mind that the expo/check in is located outside though which can get pretty warm (May in Texas).  If you are racing but still want to do some shopping at the expo, I would suggest going earlier in the day and taking fluids with you to stay hydrated.</p>
<p><strong>Swim Preview</strong></p>
<p>The swim course was pretty simple with only a few turns, therefore only having a few opportunities for bottlenecks with the swimmers.  The first turn is about ¾ of a mile out, leaving time for the athletes to spread out and get in a groove before having to take a sharp turn.  The first turn was the only congested part of the swim course.  Beware that once athletes take the last turn into the canal part of the swim, the water can get pretty choppy since the canal is not very wide.  However, it is most likely that the athletes will be spread out enough by then to eliminate some of the waves.  Also, athletes should plan on warm water temperatures and most likely not needing a wetsuit if they feel comfortable swimming without one.  The course is only one loop which is much easier than having to do two loops that require more energy to enter and exit the water multiple times.</p>
<p><strong>Bike Preview</strong></p>
<p>The bike course is also one large loop, with sufficient markers and volunteers stationed at possible points of confusion.  The majority of the course is flat and fast, which allows athletes to get comfortable in their aero positions and race at a good pace.  It is very important to remember fluids on the bike course as the weather has the potential to be very hot.  Aid stations are located every ten miles with sufficient water, energy drinks and food for the athletes but it is important that athletes always have enough water on them.</p>
<p>I felt pretty good on the bike up until around mile 90 when my body hit a little wall.  In order to stay focused and encouraged, I started to treat the aid stations as small “goals” that I had to reach.  By mentally giving myself shorter goals along the long course, I was able to distract myself and keep pushing to the transition area. The course is not very spectator friendly for those who parked in the race venue area at the Woodlands Waterway because traffic makes it hard for spectators to get in/out with cars.  The best place for spectators to see the athletes is at the beginning of the course (before athletes leave the Waterway) and when they return to T2.  A significant amount of the course winds through quiet, country roads with very few cars or people, thus it is important that athletes have enough nutrition and bike maintenance supplies.  However, other parts of the course are on busier roads where the only the shoulder or right lane is blocked off for the riders.</p>
<p><strong>Run Preview</strong></p>
<p>The run was definitely the best part of the race.  The course was three loops and very spectator friendly.  Part of the course runs along the canal while the back half winds through neighborhoods.  The course was pretty flat and very well marked, with no confusion for the athletes and aid stations promptly stationed at every mile.  To my surprise, I felt pretty good on the run, giving the credit to the awesome people out there cheering and my <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton shoes</a> of course!  The last mile before the finish was amazing with the huge crowd and winding finish, definitely making all of the hard work worth it in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Transition Preview</strong></p>
<p>Transition was well organized and clearly marked for the athletes.  Lots of volunteers were available in the changing tents which was helpful.   I actually took quite a long break in T2 and had a quick chat with some of the volunteers while I ate my peanut butter sandwich (15 minutes to be exact!).  They were more than happy to have the company in the tent.  Always be sure to thank the fantastic volunteers along the way!</p>
<p><strong>Summary &amp; Tips for Spectators</strong></p>
<p>The whole race venue is great for spectators, with the Marriott hotel located right next to the expo and lots of good restaurants and a movie theater right in the area.  However, trying to drive around on race day could pose problems for spectators.  The bike course uses one of the only roads that leads into the Woodlands Waterway area (where all of the race activities occur) so spectators could find themselves in slow moving traffic if they want to leave/return during the race.  I would suggest spectators parking in the race venue area and planning on staying in the Waterway area all day.  Spectators could bring a bike to ride around the course area in order to cheer on the athletes.  Lots of restaurants, shopping and a movie theater will provide entertainment while the athletes are racing.</p>
<p>Overall, Ironman Texas was a great experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in racing.  It was a great venue, volunteers, course and spectators and I would definitely race it again.</p>

<p>My wife’s grandmother lived to 103, and the holidays just past have reminded me of how she lived. She was not a runner, nor did she do a lot of cardio, except for sauce stirring and daily walks to markets and church. Our own local legend Frank Buckles who lived to 110 ate in this manner too; he was a farmer.</p>
<p>Walking and running are good for you, but without proper nutrition one will not achieve optimal health.</p>
<p>On  this topic, I encourage you to read <a href=""http://naturalrunningcenter.com/2013/01/03/runners-sugar-addiction-white-stuff-running-wearing-out-probably-dr-phil-maffetone/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://naturalrunningcenter.com/2013/01/03/runners-sugar-addiction-white-stuff-running-wearing-out-probably-dr-phil-maffetone/', 'Dr. Phil Maffetone’s most recent Natural Running Center’s article');"">Dr. Phil Maffetone’s most recent Natural Running Center’s article</a> that examines the negative impact of sugar consumption (even from refined-flour food favorites such as bagels) and the runner.  As he points out, “Unfortunately, too many of these calories burned during a workout are in the form of sugar and not fat. This occurs because the consumption of sugar affects one’s metabolism, forcing the body to use much more glucose for energy and too little fat. The result is less energy available for working out and virtually all other activities, and, because less fat is used for energy, it’s stored throughout the body.”</p>
<p>Best-selling food author Michael Pollan has written extensively on the topic of sound, life-extending nutrition. He states, “Cultures eating wide variety of traditional diets do not get Western diseases.” How true.</p>
<p>And many of us have committed to memory his simple recommendation: “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants”</p>
<p>In his book, “Food Rules,” he identified “64 Health and Nutrition Facts. The Unfortunate Truths” Here’s 10 of them from his useful list:</p>
<p>2. Don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.<br>
17. Eat only foods that have been cooked by humans.<br>
18. Don’t ingest foods made in places where everyone is required to wear a surgical cap.<br>
19. If it came from a plant, eat it; if it was made in a plant, don’t.<br>
20. It’s not food if it arrived through the window of your car<br>
21. It’s not food if it’s called by the same name in every language (Think Big Mac, Cheetos or Pringles)<br>
37. The whiter the bread, the sooner you’ll be dead,<br>
57. Don’t get your fuel from the same place your car does.<br>
58. Do all your eating at a table<br>
64. Break the rules once in a while!</p>

<p>About a month ago, I had a rethink of my season, and made some mid-season alterations to my calendar, and my focus for the remainder of 2013. Rather than bore you with the details of the next six months, I’ll try to cover these races as they happen.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago I began my preparation to do an Olympic distance race (i.e. Port Douglas 5150) on one weekend, then back it up the following weekend with the Cairns Ironman 70.3.  The reason I decided to do these races is that it had been such a long time between races and also coming off a chest infection, I just wanted to see where I was at in terms of fitness.  The 5150 was mainly a hit-out event, and I was preparing myself to have a good crack at the Ironman 70.3.</p>
<p>So the 5150 race was great, I felt good and enjoyed it, I got a 6th place there, which was what I expected for the field of athletes, and my ability in short course racing. I spent the week in Port Douglas (about an hour drive north of Cairns, Queensland) training with Clayton “Clayto” Fettel and Joey Lampe. I had recovered so well and was feeling on top of my game.  Clayto was racing the full Ironman, while Joey and I had booked our start for the Ironman 70.3, which was being held simultaneously with the full distance event in Cairns.</p>
<p>Then, in a moment of sheer stupidity, the thought came into my mind to give the Ironman a crack.  With no proper Ironman-build in my training, and only six days from race start, I tossed out the idea to my Team.  Weirdly enough, I got the support of my coach, manager, and wife, which mutually supported the idea, and with less than six days to go, I got the go ahead to do Ironman Cairns. My preparation for this race was not what I usually do, as it was all about the 70.3 distance, so it was to be interesting to see how the body would hold up.</p>
<p>Race morning/wife’s birthday, I was lucky enough to see a nice clear ocean , which I was told was infested with Croc’s (the reptile, not the fluorescent foam shoes) and only a little whisper of breeze. My swim was pretty crappy and I came out further back than I normally do due to missing two weeks of swimming (as I had a chest infection leading into this race).  So after a quick transition I was onto the bike and looking forward to a scenic ride up the coastline and seeing the gorgeous tropical North Queensland …I wish!!!</p>
<p>It was “balls to the wall” to play catch up to just get back onto the main pack of riders I was expecting to come out of the water with.  So I caught New Zealand ‘s Cam Brown, Matty White and Todd Israel around 15km mark.  Knowing that Luke McKenzie, Clayto, and Chris “Macca” McCormack weren’t in that group, I knew I had caught onto the group riding in equal forth.</p>
<p>Another 15km up the road we caught Macca. Feeling quite good, I was driving the group up into Port Douglas.  Macca took a turn up front and I was sitting second with Cam, Matty and Todd still intact.  We approached a bit of a tight spot on the road, and we naturally bunched up, and there was a Technical Official sitting off the back of our group.  He rode up to me and issued me a drafting penalty. It was a silly mistake, where I wasn’t able to drop back quick enough in a technical section of the course.  He might not have had the best angle to see it, but he made the call, and I had to cop it.</p>
<p>It was a little disappointing as I felt I had been off the front of my group for most of the ride and this happens in such a silly spot. So I then decided to surge forward and haul a$$ up the road as I had to get into the penalty box, knowing I didn’t want to lose the ground I made to even catch these boys in the first place.  Plus I knew I still had Luke and Clayto out front, which is a scary combination, as they both are strong cyclist.  In my angered state, I was able to gain around 2 mins by the time I jumped into the penalty box (…with a gorgeous view might I add).</p>
<p>When I saw the boys go past, I might have uttered a few choice words, and I apologize to the Technical Officials which were staffing the Penalty Box.  My emotions may have gotten the best of me in that situation, but I had already worked so hard after a poor swim, to have to claw myself back again.  After my penalty was served, I was out of the box on a mission.  I caught the boys back at around the 130km mark.</p>
<p>On the ride back into T2 us boys were having a little friendly banter when Matty White decides to pull a turn… Coming past me, he says “I’m a #@%ing cheat”.  LOL.  Makes the ride a lot more enjoyable when you have good guys out there, keeping you motivated, and talking a bit of smack.</p>
<p>Back into the transition I was told a few splits and McKenzie was 21:58 up the road.  Geeeeezzzz, I thought to myself – I’ve got a bit of work, and it was going to have to happen quick smart.  So Macca and I ran together for a bit, before he took off.  I let him go, but soon caught back up to him. Macca didn’t seem his usual self, which was understandable due to him being in hospital at the start of the week with a Kidney infection.</p>
<p>We ran together for around 4km and Macca was feeling worse, poor guy. I then dropped Macca and whilst running I saw McKenzie on the way back from the Yorky’s Nob loop, and it was pretty clear to me he had a massive lead. I thought to myself the only way I was going to make time up was to run hard into the head wind.</p>
<p>I overtook Clayto which put me in second place.  I kept getting splits from the awesome spectators lining the course.  It’s a long run into town, then multiple loops along the foreshore, so the end of the race is full of spectators.  I was consistently reducing the 21:58 deficit that Luke built on his Swim/Bike combination.</p>
<p>I ended up crossing the line in second, and was only 4:38 back, taking over 17 minutes of Luke’s lead at T2.  I ran a 2:44:24 marathon which was over 10 minutes faster than the second fastest Marathon of the day.  I guess looking back now the results it could have been a little different if I didn’t get my drafting penalty.  As I could take 4 minutes off my time, and possibly fresher legs at not having to play catch up twice during the bike leg.  But all-in-all, I can’t complain and I have lived and learned from my mistakes …until next race!</p>
<p>Well done to Luke McKenzie on a champion effort. Also, I take my visor off to Macca – legend, and tough as nails!</p>
<p>So for me now the game plan is a few easy days then back into it as I head back to the states for a couple of races in a few weeks.</p>

				<p><b>Never Give In: Running the Inca Trail Marathon</b></p>
<p>How tough could running the Inca Trail be? Getting to the Inca Trail was much easier than Antarctica. No boats, no hurricane, just a 5-mile hike into the start line the day before the marathon. We arrived on a Saturday, a few days before the race, in a cute, little, town called Cusco, Peru. Here, we would spend several days acclimating to 12,000 feet and drinking lots of <a href=""http://library.hidalgofoods.com/?p=321"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://library.hidalgofoods.com/?p=321', 'coca tea');"">coca tea</a>. The locals consider coca tea leaves to be the miracle plant for acclimatizing. Everywhere you go in Cusco, there are coca tea leaves, which you either chew or use to make tea.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4320"" alt=""Peru Marathon"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-1024x680.jpg"" width=""625"" height=""415"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-624x414.jpg 624w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p>I didn’t experience any significant issues going from 7,000 feet to 12,000 feet. Some people get nauseated, headaches, decreased appetite and even fatigue. We did several 4-5 mile downhill runs over the next couple days to get used to running in the altitude. Tuesday we hiked into our race camp near the start of the Inca Trail. We slept in tents and prepared for a 4 a.m. race start time. The park entrance into Machu Picchu closes at 3:30 p.m. every day. An early morning race start would give us 11.5 hours to reach this gate, which lies 2 miles from the actual finish line inside Machu Picchu. Those runners who don’t make the cutoff either camp out for the night on the Inca Trail at make shift camps set up by the race organizers, Andes Adventures, or take a path down to a different finish line below Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>Race night was short and not the most ideal preparation for a long running day. A 2 a.m. breakfast cooked by the Peruvian porters consisting of porridge, pancakes and bananas was definitely a good start though! There would be over 30 porters that would assist us on race day. They would carry our 22kg ration of gear we used for camping and assist us along the race course with water stops as well as encouragement and any other issues that might arise.</p>
<p>In the 18-year history of this race, only once had it rained!  We can now make that twice! Within the first hundred yards of starting the marathon, raindrops began to fall, turning the trail into a rocky, muddy mess. The biggest obstacle to navigate in the first couple hours of darkness was the huge “cow pies” on the trail left by the farm animals that inhabited and roamed the first mountain pass. What a slippery mess they were! Once again it was the Newton trainers that served me well. I chose a lighter trainer shoe on the trails over the Newton trail shoe, but that is just my preference.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4319"" alt=""Peru Marathon 3"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-3.jpg"" width=""720"" height=""960"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-3.jpg 720w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-3-624x832.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px""></a></p>
<p>The toughest challenge may not have been the climate or the elevation. We would climb about 10,400 feet and descend 11,000 feet over the course of the day. I experienced some swelling in my fingers that was very noticeable as I reached Dead Woman’s Pass at 13,799 feet. After the race, I realized I wasn’t the only one experiencing this. It is common at these elevations to experience swelling in your extremities. My fingers looked like little sausages, but quickly went away after I descended to lower altitudes. The high altitude affected my normal race appetite also. I found myself not drinking and taking in the energy gels as planned.</p>
<p>Each of these marathons has been a great learning experience. I have become much better at listening to my body and adapting to the different challenges I face during these runs. Instead of only consuming my normal nutrition that had served me well in training runs, I had to switch it up and grab a cup of chicken broth. That seemed to work very well for me. My body was probably craving a little more sodium than usual. Despite my lack of thirst, I knew I was behind in my water intake and had to keep up on my hydration. My hydration pack made that much easier, since there was little effort needed to just take sips frequently along the way. Your hydration pack is crucial in these races. I had mine under my running jacket during the race so I didn’t have to remove my hydration pack each time I needed to put my jacket on or off. A hydration pack should just feel like a part of your body. The last thing you need to worry about is something bouncing on your back or chaffing you.</p>
<p>So what was the toughest challenge? The rocks and stone steps that lined the 26.2 miles of the Inca Trail were probably the biggest challenge of the day. Climbing the two-foot steps, which never seemed to end, provided a huge challenge to the hamstrings. I can’t even tell you how many false summits there are on that course. You think you are at the top and you get there and realize, “You’re not!” After all the long climbs, there would then be a long rocky descent, which entailed never-ending pounding to your feet on uneven stones. The descents were a true test of how well you had trained your quads. This was the first marathon that I wore my <a href=""http://110playharder.com/play-makers/winter-vinecki/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://110playharder.com/play-makers/winter-vinecki/', '110% Play Harder Compression Soxs');"">110% Play Harder Compression Soxs</a> during the race and not just for recovery after. I think it made a huge difference in how fresh my legs felt at the end of this grueling 9-hour run. You can bet you will see me running the longer distances in them in the future as well.</p>
<p>I never set out to win the Inca Trail Marathon. I just wanted to have the best possible race for me that day. The number “3” has been following me for a while, 3rd place overall female in Kenya and Antarctica Marathon! I am always thinking to myself, “Is today going to be the perfect race?” We must admit, we all dream of that perfect race or perfect competition. My training is always purposeful; I fuel my body nutritionally and prepare mentally for success as an athlete, especially as an endurance runner. The Inca Trail Marathon wasn’t the perfect race for me, but I was the best female runner given the circumstances on that course, on that given day. That race proved age is not a barrier and certainly, as the 4th place finisher overall that day, gender is not a barrier.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4318"" alt=""Peru Marathon 2"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-2-768x1024.jpg"" width=""625"" height=""833"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-2-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-2-624x832.jpg 624w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Peru-Marathon-2.jpg 960w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p>What do I remember most about that day? It probably isn’t standing on the finish line with my first overall female marathon win. It is the memories of me trying to race the porters on the descents and still not being able to keep up with them as they descended the stone paths with a 100-pound pack on their back. It was the reality that all the hikers I would pass on the Inca Trail that day would take 4-5 days to complete the Inca Trail, something I would complete in just 9 hours and 18 minutes. It was sharing my iphone the night before the race with two young Peruvian girls so they could play games and escape their isolated reality for a while. It was donating my clothing, as well as my brothers’ clothing, to the nearly 40 porters that would assist us on race day so that their families would have clothing. Or maybe it was waiting at the finish to not only see my mom run an 11 hour 20 minute marathon, but also to be on the podium with me as the 3rd place overall female.</p>
<p>The victory on the Inca Trail was not only a personal victory, but more importantly, a victory for prostate cancer awareness! Next stop is the <a href=""http://wintervinecki.com/world-marathon-tour/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://wintervinecki.com/world-marathon-tour/', 'Sunrise to Sunset Marathon');"">Sunrise to Sunset Marathon</a> in remote Mongolia at the end of this month. Following Mongolia is New Zealand and Athens, Greece later this year. In the end, I hope that I inspire others and teach the world to Never Give In. Never Give In despite the odds, despite your circumstances, despite your age, despite your gender, despite what others might say.</p>
<p>NEVER GIVE IN!</p>

He and his business partners bought the oldest running store in the Twin Cities area. The store, <a href=""http://www.gearrunningstore.com"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gearrunningstore.com', 'Gear Running');"">Gear Running</a> is based in Edina, Minnesota, had been the “it” store in town from 1985-2006, but when the store owner started to step away to pursue other personal interests, the store began to lose its footing in the market. Horan had been an avid runner since high school and had at one point run for the Gear Running store team. He also had worked in clothing retail for most of his career and was looking for a retail opportunity to call his own. When the chance to buy Gear Running presented itself, he jumped on it.</p>
<p>Horan’s own market research had turned him onto “natural running”. He understood that it wasn’t just a fad, but a trend that would play a role in the future of the running market. “I thought the Newton technology was fascinating, how they spent so much time trying to mimic the barefoot gate, while still being substantial under foot. And we were lucky that our inventory levels were such that we could bring in a lot of it, and bring it in right away.” Horan hoped that a new brand like Newton Running would help him to differentiate his store from his competitors</p>
<p>Horan’s differentiation plan paid off, Newton became Horan’s number one brand after the first year he carried it. Gear Running has in fact sold more Newton shoes than any other storefront.</p>
<p>Thanks to many years spent on the retail side of the clothing industry, Horan says, “I had very good experience in retail and great connections as far as a customer base.” When he changed to Gear Running, many of his former clothing clients, began to visit him at the shoe store. Others, aside from his competitors, were also happy to see him take over the store. Many local runners had fond memories of the store when it was doing well. “People would always say, ‘Gear Running. I love that store,’” says Horan.</p>
<p>And his customers loved Newton shoes. “Every day, I was open jawed at the number of people who came in because of Newton shoes or who were turned on when they saw the shoe. We did well from the get go. And it kept building and building and building.” And, it’s not always your typical elite runner who is into minimal running. “We have guys all the time, they don’t appear to be the kind of guy who would run in that type of shoe. Suddenly they’re all intrigued.”</p>
<p>“We have a former NFL hall of famer who has bought about 12 pairs. He thought his running career was over. He’s a bigger guy, but in great shape. He heard about Newtons. He bought one pair and then came back and said ‘I need two more pair,’” explains Horan. “We have a lot of customers who have had great improvement with the Newtons and feel like they can run again. And the 30-day guarantee is a nice safety net to have in your back pocket.”</p>
<p>Horan says there is another group of 10 to 12 women who walk around the nearby lake. “They all have the pink Newton shoes. They’re walkers, but they love them.” He adds, “The shoes sell themselves to a degree because they’re so colorful.”</p>
<p>The other secret to Horan’s success is a partnership he founded with <a href=""http://www.teamortho.us"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.teamortho.us', 'Team Ortho');"">Team Ortho</a>, the largest race organizer in Minnesota. “We’re their exclusive retail partner. So when we go to their expos, we’re the only retailer there.” Horan explains that every race has a Facebook page, and Horan has run multiple contests on these pages giving away a pair of Newton shoes. “They will simply say, ‘Like’ this page to be eligible to win a pair of Newtons. And just one of those pages gets around 10,000 ‘Likes’.” He adds, “You also get all of these comments. For the most part it’s a love fest, so then other people think maybe they should try them out.” Every time a new product comes in Horan will have Team Ortho give away a pair. “They’ll post the picture and people are just like ‘those are the coolest!’” He sold 200 pairs in December last year as a result of these social media giveaways.</p>

<p>For Newtonites, there’s a uniquely memorable moment when the unmistakable pop that characterizes the Newton ride first energized our stride. Nearly a decade ago, before terms like “minimalist” and “natural” invaded running vocabulary, Newton founders Danny Abshire and Jerry Lee spent years perfecting that feel. Danny and Jerry knew “it” when they felt “it”, launching the Newton brand and an ever-evolving product line that has always stayed true to that trademark experience.</p>
<p>The Newton ride is different. It transcends shoe technology and running form to simply make every run better. So that “aha” moment reappears every time you lace up your Newtons. In celebration of all that differentiates us, from our characteristic colors to our protruding lugs, we launch our new Newton brand campaign.</p>
<p>Hello better!</p>

				<p><b>By Kyle Pease</b></p>
<p><i>Brent and Kyle Pease are a team of brothers from Atlanta Georgia who compete together in athletic competitions — despite the fact that Kyle is relegated to a wheelchair, the result of Cerebral Palsy at birth. Brent, his older brother, pushes, pedals and paddles Kyle in 5k’s, 10k’s, marathons and triathlons to encourage those who witness their efforts that anything is possible. Through their foundation, </i><a href=""http://www.kylepeasefoundation.org/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kylepeasefoundation.org/', 'The Kyle Pease Foundation');""><i>The Kyle Pease Foundation</i></a><i>, the duo raise funds to promote success for persons with disabilities by providing assistance to meet their individual needs through sports.  </i></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/story_profile_pic.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-4364 alignnone"" alt=""story_profile_pic"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/story_profile_pic.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/story_profile_pic.jpg 500w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/story_profile_pic-300x180.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px""></a></p>
<p><i>The following is from Kyle Pease’s blog: Where There is a Wheel There’s a Way:</i></p>
<p>I’ve been finding it difficult to fall asleep at night knowing that everything that Brent and I have been working toward is just around the corner. Up until this point, the greatest moment of our running career occurred recently at the Peachtree 10K, where we became the first assisted pair in the long history of the race to compete. It doesn’t get any better than the local crowds cheering our names as we traveled 6.2 miles through the familiar streets of our hometown Atlanta…or does it?</p>
<p>Now, just two months later, Brent and I will make Pease history as we try to have the word “Ironman” etched next to our names. For this, we will cover 140.6 miles through the water and roadways of rural Madison, Wisconsin — 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles on the bike, and finishing with the 26.2 mile marathon. Our goal is to break the 17-hour mark, which of course would make us forever IRONMEN. But even though Brent and I are hoping for a time between 14 and 16 hours, I’ll be honest anything this side of 16:59:59 is good enough. But that one second, is the second that differentiates an Ironman from a couple of guys who competed to truly becoming Ironmen.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4362"" alt=""601356_690503014308926_868084656_n"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""960"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n.jpg 640w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/601356_690503014308926_868084656_n-624x936.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px""></a></p>
<p>Now, as strange as some people find it, I have been training harder than I ever have in my life. Many people think that I have the easy part. Although Brent may agree with them while he’s paddling, pedaling and pushing me for 140.6 miles, it is important for me to be prepared for this, too. I have never sat on a bike for nearly nine hours and the average human body is not likely to fare well without proper preparation. Brent and I are training far longer and more often than we normally do in order to get both of our bodies used to the many miles and hours out on the course. I’ve been eating better than I normally do and have been trying to increase my liquid intake. I’m struggling a bit there, as I don’t really enjoy drinking water, but it’s very important to stay hydrated. It would be a shame if Brent was up to the task, but I wasn’t. It’s important to me to not let my brother and my teammate down.</p>
<p>My trainer, Matthew Rose, (yes I have a trainer) tells me to visualize the shoot. The thought of 45,000 screaming fans lining the shoot at the end of the race is something I just can’t imagine, despite his efforts to help me mentally imagine what it will be like. That is the golden carrot hanging just in front of me that will motivate and inspire me and subsequently inspire Brent to the finish line.</p>
<p>Yet, there’s one very important thing for my readers and our fans to remember, becoming an Ironman is not and never will be for or about Brent and me. It’s about our Foundation and the people who we are hoping to inspire: People who see what we are about to accomplish and believe that anything is possible through our efforts.</p>
<p>We are very proud of the Kyle Pease Foundation and take great pleasure in seeing the looks on the faces of the athletes who compete with us. It is exciting to know that through the efforts of a few, we have impacted the lives of many. Although Brent and I will be thrilled to wear the Ironman medal around our necks on the evening of September 8th, we really know that the medal symbolically hangs from the necks of all those friends, fans, athletes and sponsors of the Kyle Pease Foundation. We know that through their continued inspiration and efforts that the only thing that will not be humanly possible is finishing in a second more than 16:59:59. Off to Wisconsin!</p>

<p>After suffering a gunshot wound to the head in an altercation, war veteran Michael Somsan was left completely blind and faced with opening a new chapter in his life. In this quest, Somsan decided to take on the impossible and make it possible, each and every day. This is exemplified in his #Extraordinary professional, athletic and philanthropic pursuits following his accident.</p>
<p>Motivated by the fact that the person who shot him never faced a judge or justice, Somsan went back to school to earn his law degree. Once becoming a lawyer, Somsan extended his services to support Modest Means and the Military Legal Assistance Project, both of which provide legal services to those in need.</p>
<p>A lifelong runner, movement became challenging for Somsan after becoming blind. He said, “I was scared to walk down a hallway”, but with his “no quit” attitude, Somsan refused to give up on running. “Running was the freedom to be outside and enjoy nature. It was very peaceful to me. I needed that part of my life back.” With time, Somsan became more and more comfortable navigating around and found running to be therapeutic again.</p>
<p>Since losing his sight over 20 years ago, Somsan has run too many marathons to count, completed two long-distance triathlons and is currently preparing to take on the long-distance triathlon championships in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii on October 8, 2016.  As one of five physically challenged athletes chosen to participate, the opportunity is a dream-come-true for Somsan. Growing up a local Hawaiian boy, he dreamt of running through the finish line on Ali’I Drive, and that dream will become reality this year.</p>
<p>This retired First Lieutenant, lawyer, philanthropist, aspiring triathlete and single dad has not and will not stop at anything to achieve the same dreams he had before he lost his vision. His legacy has always been about never giving up and always giving back. He also fights to instill this commitment into his young daughters. The family motto of “never give up and never be defeated” certainly comes to life when Somsan takes on life.</p>
<p>“It is in our uncommon endeavors where the #Extraordinary can be discovered.” – Michael Somsan</p>

				<p>By Nicole Clark</p>
<p>Back in February, I heard from my husband, Nick Clark, about the potential for a Newton Running Ambassador Team. Then, I noticed the application on Facebook to apply for the inaugural IRONMAN Foundation Newton Running Ambassador Triathlon team. It took me about a week to finish up the application process and another month until I received an official email stating that I was chosen to be part of the team.</p>
<p>Being part of this team is quite an honor. We have more than 40 teammates from around North America with one common goal: to give back to the communities in which we are racing. Our team motto is kōkua, which means “extending loving, sacrificial help to others for their benefit, not for personal gain…” This sums up exactly what our team is all about. I wanted to be part of a team that wasn’t focused on PR’s, splits and power, although that is perfectly fine, I felt like this team was going to be more than just that.  I love training, racing and being at different venues, but raising money for the different charities and community outreach programs for select IRONMAN races has been an amazing experience to be part of.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kokua.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4399"" alt=""Kokua"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kokua.png"" width=""720"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kokua.png 720w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kokua-300x200.png 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kokua-624x416.png 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px""></a></p>
<p>I am fortunate enough to live in a great community. I have amazing friends and family all over the country who have supported this experience. I reached out to a local restaurant in Louisville, Colorado, Lucky Pie, where they support fundraising events. They were kind enough to allow me to host a silent auction social. We had wonderful local business who donated for the event, ranging from teeth whitening, local triathlon shop packages, to autographed Craig Alexander Newton Running visors. We also had representation from Newton Running, Ironman and IMF teammates.</p>
<p>The monies raised by my teammates and I will go to local Henderson charities served by the IRONMAN Foundation at the IRONMAN World Championship 70.3: Coronado High School Band, Coronado High School, Clark County School District, Foothills High School, Student Council Getting 2 Tri Foundation, Grant a Gift Autism Foundation, Green Valley C.H.A.N.C.E., Green Valley Women’s Basketball, Green Valley Wrestling, Greenspun Junior High, Henderson Lacrosse Club, James Gibson Elementary, Nevada Children’s Cancer Foundation, Pinecrest Academy, SECTA Student Organization of Latinos and Somerset Academy of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>I qualified back in September 2012 at Branson 70.3 for the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships 2013.  What a great set up for the year ahead. This made fun planning for upcoming races. Leading up to Vegas, I raced the Boulder Tri Series and Kansas 70.3. I had the opportunity to race Vegas two years ago, while living in Florida. Now that I live in Colorado, with the ability to train at altitude and really knowing how to ride hills while also having the advantage of knowing what the course is like, I feel like I am a little more seasoned and prepared for a great race. I’m really looking forward to having fun, enjoying the weekend with family and friends coming to support me and meeting new teammates at our charity project.</p>

				<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> athlete and chef<a href=""http://www.auberginecarmel.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.auberginecarmel.com/', ' Justin Cogley');""> Justin Cogley</a> has done it again! This time he brings us a fall-favorite, Butternut squash and fennel soup with fried pumpkin seeds, watercress and black cardamons.</p>
<p>“As the temperatures start to drop in many parts of the country, there’s no better way to warm up than with a warm soup! This butternut squash and fennel soup has a smoky, unique taste from the black cardamon that is a nice surprise.”</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<p><strong><u>Ingredients</u></strong></p>
<p>4 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p>2 each butternut squash (about 2 1/2 lbs each) peeled and medium diced</p>
<p>2 fennel bulbs (sliced)</p>
<p>2 tbsp peeled diced fresh ginger</p>
<p>1/2 cup tomato juice or V8</p>
<p>1/2 gallon purified water or vegetable stock</p>
<p>3 each star anise</p>
<p>3 each black cardamom (cracked no shell)</p>
<p>Sea salt</p>
<p>1 limes (zest and juice)</p>
<p><strong><u>Method</u></strong></p>
<p>Heat a large sauce pot over medium heat and add the olive oil, diced squash, sliced fennel, and diced ginger.  Cook over medium heat until the squash and fennel are soft about 10 minutes.  Next add the tomato juice, stock or water, and the spices. Slowly cook over medium heat until the stock is reduced by half. About 30 minutes. Remember every stove is different so you might have to add more stock or a little more cooking time. Finally, blend the soup in a couple batches in a blender or use a hand blender. Check the seasoning and add salt and lime juice to taste.  Enjoy now with some watercress and fried pumpkin seeds or chill the soup for later.</p>
<p>1 bunch of watercress (you can sub arugula) Just toss a hand full with some olive oil, lemon juice, and salt.</p>
<p>The pumpkin seeds I fry in 375 degree oil just for 10 seconds and drain them on paper towels seasoning with fine sea salt. I fry about 1/2 cup at a time in a medium large sauce pan in grapeseed oil or a canola blend oil. Once cool they will keep for a week but I always snack on them so they never make it that long.</p>
<p><strong><u>Chef Tip</u>: </strong>If you have a juicer you can juice some raw butternut squash and use that fresh juice to thin out your soup.</p>

<p>“I view it the same way as brushing my teeth, or eating breakfast. Running is part of my every day routine.” After a 15 year battle with anorexia, Pam Reed found running as her outlet, her savior. She felt similarities between her fight to overcome anorexia nervosa and the world of competitive racing, and she set out on an #Extraordinary journey to beat them both.</p>
<p>The name “Pam Reed” spread like wild fire through the running world in 2002 after she broke the existing women’s record by 1 hour and 51 minutes at Badwater, “The World’s Toughest Foot Race.” This 135 mile race is just one of the 90+ ultra-marathon events that has solidified Pam as one of the top athletes (male or female) in the history of American ultra-distance running.</p>
<p>Pam finds her “zen” in extreme activity. “I am certain that not running for three hours every day would very quickly make me ill…while nobody’s forcing me to do this, it’s not really a choice, either. There’s something in my nature that makes it really hard for me to sit still. I am temperamentally attuned to perpetual motion.” She doesn’t believe in training logs or following the advice of coaches, she just loves to move, to run. Ultra-running may seem outlandish to some, but that is what Pam loves most about it. The longer or more difficult a race, the more satisfaction she gets out of it.</p>
<p>When Reed isn’t competitively running, she is organizing the Tucson Marathon, Family Fitness Fest and the Jackson Hole Half Marathon, skate skiing and running with her dogs Kona and Tundra. In addition to the 90+ ultramarathons Pam has run in over the years, she has completed 46 long-distance triathlon races, with her husband alongside her for many of them! It’s simply #Extraordinary how she finds time to do all of this! This year alone, Pam has already completed the Sustina 100 with a sled, Zio 100, IM Texas, Bighorn 100, IM Vineman, UTMB and the Wasatch 100.</p>
<p>Running will continue to keep Pam sane.  She has no intent of stopping anytime soon. On her #Extraordinary journey of overcoming anorexia to becoming one of the top athletes in ultra-distance running, Pam’s wise words to remember  are, “If you want something bad enough you can take the pain that it hands you. You can do more than you think you can.”</p>

<p>Justin Cogley traveled the world as a Professional Figure Skater with Feld Entertainment’s Disney on Ice before he started his career as a professional chef. Justin spent most of his touring days in Japan, SE Asia, Australia and Europe. It was traveling, working with international talent; cultures and experiences that opened Cogley’s eyes to a world filled with contemporary flavors, cuisines, techniques and food markets. Justin’s journey started with figure skating, but most certainly ended with an explosive passion for the food industry.  As soon as his time with “Disney on Ice” came to an end, Justin enrolled at Western Culinary Institute to take his love for food to the next level.</p>
<p>Justin’s dream came true right out of culinary school as he joined Chef Charlie Trotter’s team in Chicago IL. There he worked his way to Chef de Cuisine. After a solid 7 years of building his culinary resume Justin moved to Carmel CA where he currently runs an internationally recognized fine dining kitchen. Cogley praises his dishes for having broad combinations of flavors and textures creating each one of Aubergines courses with purpose.</p>
<p>Like every renowned chef, a lot of trial and error goes into perfecting each plate. Day after day of tasting different foods and combinations of ingredients, he spent endless hours in the kitchen on his feet.  Before long Cogley reached an unhealthy weight and had low energy, barely enough to get him through his 12-15 hour days in the kitchen. Justin was inspired to change his life by winning an entry into the Big Sur Marathon. Enough people told Justin he couldn’t do it or shouldn’t do it which; is exactly what he then had to do. Justin finished that race with a new attitude towards life. Running has become more than a part of Cogley’s everyday routine. He has made incredible friends, renewed by nature and has new inspiration in the kitchen. Cogley has found that running sharpens his mind and body before he returns to the kitchen to sharpen his knives.</p>
<p>Cogley isn’t one to stop dreaming. Running check, now what… well that was easy for him to figure out. He turned back to the same person who inspired him to run and soon they were biking. You guessed it swimming was next. How does Justin add so much to his schedule? He has more energy now than ever before.  It’s the days he doesn’t run, bike or swim that are a problem.</p>
<p>To date, Justin has completed 3 Ironman races, 2 ultra-trail running races and countless other running events. He is excited about what the next few years will bring.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, Justin and his team at <a href=""http://www.auberginecarmel.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.auberginecarmel.com/', 'Aubergine');"">Aubergine</a> have achieved great accomplishments. In 2014 they earned Forbes Travel Guide’s highest Five-Star rating in the restaurant business and in early 2015 the team and restaurant was nominated for three James Beard Foundation awards. The restaurant popularity and Cogley’s skills continue to expand year after year. Justin was named “Best New Chef” by Food &amp; Wine magazine truly an accomplishment.</p>
<p>In addition to testing his limits in the kitchen and his endurance training, Cogley participated in the “Chefs Cycle for No Kid Hungry” 300 mile bike ride down the coast of California for the first time in 2016. 125 chefs and restaurant professionals participated in the ride and rose just over 1,000,000, to end hunger in America. It was moving for Justin an event that he plans to partake in again. “The event fit my personality, and experience perfectly. What I didn’t expect was to be completely moved and inspired by the other riders, and the kids.”</p>
<p>Justin’s story is inspiring; life takes lots of different paths and sometimes it’s the road blocks that build strength, endurance and drive to take an individual to the next level. Justin has big dreams ahead and encourages everyone to stay healthy, strong and believe in themselves.</p>

				<p>We recommend new <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton</a> Runners start out taking their shoes out for a 3 to 4 mile spin to get used to the lugs. Before she was even a Newton Running athlete, <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/brenda-guajardo/"">Brenda Guajardo</a> took a pair of <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/women-motion-v"">Women’s Motions</a> right out of the box for a 20 mile run. “It was a moment that redefined my running because for the first time a pair of running shoes felt like they were built just for me.”</p>
<p>Brenda took up ultra-running in 2008 when she lived in Virginia Beach. She liked the idea of running a distance that generally would require a car for transportation and since this idea Brenda has competed in races that are over 300+ miles long!</p>
<p>In 2016, Brenda ran 4 races that were 125+ miles, landing two 1<sup>st</sup> place finishes! One of her 2016 races was the “Pheidippides Race” which was 304 miles.  Continue reading for Brendas personal recap of this 74:35:43 second long race!</p>
<p>“The race begins in Athens, Greece at the Ancient Market with an evening start. Before the race begins there is traditional Grecian dancing and music with performers wearing authentic dress. One of my favorite things about racing in Greece is that it’s more of a cultural experience than just running. The runners are following almost the exact routes that historical figures ran during times of battles and wars. It’s really meaningful for the locals to share this history with the runners because in a sense, it’s the ability to relive their history in modern times. In the case of this race (and who the race is named after) it was a professional runner named, Pheidippides, who was asked to run [from Athens] to Sparta and request help from the Sparta military to fight off the Persians. While most people think Pheidippides only ran the distance of a marathon, the truth is that he ran from Athens to Sparta and back to Athens to deliver the news, a total of 304-miles. It was only after this journey that he then ran to the city of Marathon to share the news of the victory where he died from exhaustion. Who knew that ultra-running would teach me more about world history than sitting in a classroom ever did!?</p>
<p>The mountain range we crossed over twice is impressive. This is where the road turns to trail and back to road. The climb feels like it leads you up into the clouds with the most amazing vistas. There is something very peaceful about this section because of the silence in the air. In terms of the course, it’s probably the most difficult part, but the views are worth the pain. The race takes place just before winter, so during the race the runners witness  the shepherds migrating their flocks of sheep across the lands. It seems like this would be something you would see only in the movies, but this is an example of the experiences I have the opportunity to see because of running.</p>
<p>This year the field was comprised of 16 runners, myself and 15 men.   Of the 16 runners, there were 6 different countries that were represented; Greece, France, Belgium, Finland, Japan, and me coming from the USA. I must admit, I really have a total love and passion for Italy so I race wearing Italian colors which confuses people. Ha!</p>
<p>It was interesting because we only saw each other very briefly at the pre-race meeting which was held just a few hours before the start of the race. At least in my case, my focus was on getting my race number and rushing back to the house to pack up the gear and take my last long hot shower before setting off for the long journey. While we were standing at the start line there was electricity in the air from the excitement. I felt this unity with the other runners because of what we were about to try to do. One of the Greek runners would be running this route for the third time!</p>
<p>I wish I could pinpoint exactly what parts of the race were the hardest but the race was difficult at different times, for different reasons. I’ve run through one night in other races but three nights was tough! There were many times I would sing out loud because it was the only way to stay awake. Other times, I wasn’t sure if I was actually awake or sleeping so I would belt out a scream just to figure it out. I needed to actually feel the intensity of the scream in my throat and feel the adrenaline kicking in again to jolt me awake. I’m sure the race officials and the police car behind me probably thought I was crazy! Having a logical thought process was very difficult after the second day and for almost two days straight I lived with constant hallucinations even during the day. I would see people or things that weren’t there.</p>
<p>The terrain of the race was almost entirely on asphalt, aside from a brief section of the trail near the mountain of Artemisias. While some may consider road running easier, there is the element of constant pounding on your joints and feet from the unforgiving asphalt that make it feel just as hard as running on an uneven trail. The cold temperatures during the early mornings made running tricky, as it was cold enough for frost to develop on the roads – another obstacle to battle! During this time of the year in Greece, the temperature fluctuates a lot. In Texas, where I live, we have two seasons: hot and hotter, so racing in freezing temperatures to hot and back to freezing was quite an adventure for me.</p>
<p>I had minimal problems during the race, which I attribute to my coach and physical therapist that helped me prepare for the race. At one point during the race, my left calf muscle swelled up to twice its size! I had brought wraps with me just in case a situation like this occurred, so I did the only thing I could think of which was to wrap that area of my leg. After a day of keeping it wrapped my calf went back to normal and the pain went away. Towards the end of the race, the lower area of my shins began to turn purple. Since the only pain I felt was the justifiable discomfort from the mileage I knew I didn’t have stress fractures. The trapezius muscle was probably the worst of everything from holding my head up to maintain good form. It never occurred to me to strengthen this area in training. There were long hours were I felt a burning sensation in this area and I finally put a mini hot pack on it to help ease some of the pain.</p>
<p>The question I am most often asked is “how many blisters did I have at the finish,” that answer was zero. My feet were never an issue. I wore the exact same pair of Newton Gravity’s from start to finish. When I reached the finish line, those Gravity’s had completed 1000 miles! Part of the reason why I love the Gravity shoe so much is the power of the lugs. The Gravity tends to have a more rigid ride, and I prefer to have power in my shoe and save any cushion for after the race during recovery.</p>
<p>In 2016,I had set out to race what I personally dubbed as the “Ultra Road Running Grand Slam.” This personal goal consisted of completing four ultra-road races in 2016. These four races would mean running 717 miles in 181 days, something that has never been done before. The races were Nove Colli 125-miles in Italy, Badwater Ultramarathon 135-miles in the USA, Spartathlon 153-miles in Greece, and the Pheidippides 304-mile race in Greece. There is one runner from Italy, Paolo Bucci, who finished the first three races in 2011. The Pheidippides race didn’t exist during the year he completed the three races. So this year my goal was to try and match his three races and also add Pheidippides. Unfortunately I had some issues at Spartathlon. After completing 106 of the 153 miles I pulled out of the race missing my overall goal for the year. It happens!</p>
<p>My original goal for this race was to finish Pheidippides just over an hour faster than the men’s course record, which was 78 hours and 41 minutes. Don’t ask me how I came up with this but it seemed to make perfect sense, and I went for it. I knew this goal was going to be a major undertaking and a stretch for me to push this hard but I’m also at a point in my life where I’d rather try and completely fail, than play it safe. I decided to take a chance on myself and I went after it. From start to finish I have to say that this was probably the single most liberating experience I’ve had in a race.</p>
<p>Pheidippides was liberating for two reasons: Emotionally, this race stripped me down to absolutely nothing. During the three days of running I let go of a lot of sadness and hurt that burdened me this year and that at times negatively affected me physically.. The second reason this race was liberating to me was because I really took the time to appreciate the land I ran across and the people I met along the way. I felt immense gratitude for the gift of running, the people who helped me and cheered for me along the way, and most importantly having the opportunity to be part of Greece’s history. I was able to share this journey with three incredible people who crewed me, but I was also able to share this racing adventure online with fellow runners who understand the passion and commitment of running.</p>
<p>304 miles later, I finished first place out of all 16 runners, (against the men since I was the only female) with a time of 74 hours and 35 minutes. I broke the men’s course record by 4 hours and 12 minutes – something that never occurred to me might be possible… “<em>per ardua ad astra” (through adversity to the stars)!”</em></p>

				<p>This #Extraordinary blog features a race recap written by <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> Athlete <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/harvey-lewis/"">Harvey Lewis</a>, followed by an overview of his busy, busy life.</p>
<p>“Run further than you ever imagined.” This is the call of the Gobi Trail Ultra, a 248-mile (400 km) race across the remote Gobi Desert of China. Athletes must carry all of their own articles and cover the distance with no course markings. The description both fascinated me and made me nervous. My friend Carlos Sa of Portugal who skied across Greenland this past spring said good luck with a look of concern when I told him this past summer.</p>
<p>I ran my first ultra 20 years ago and while I have credits to my record such as winning the Badwater 135, qualifying and running in more 24 Hour World Championships with Team USA more than any other American male, and experiences in extreme environments including heat and cold this was still going to be tough. The sheer distance, near total self-reliance, and navigation would pose significant new challenges.</p>
<p>The race started before sunrise on a Wednesday morning this fall at the Ashoka Buddhist Temple with a field of 30; nearly half Chinese, the rest from various countries around the planet. Running has become quite popular in China with rising income levels and the race was a reflection of the growing Chinese affluence. Everything was prepared to perfection and my concerns about a disorganized race evaporated. The race followed the pilgrimage route of Xuanzang, a famous Buddhist who became a focal point of Chinese lore due to his journey more than 15 centuries earlier, where he disappeared for years on a mission to discover ancient Buddhist manuscripts. Fireworks started the race and the runners were quickly spread out across miles, that would grow to be scores of miles. Navigating was dependent on a mandatory GPS unit runners carry to follow a digital track to the 36 check points across the race. Marshall Ulrich, the only other American runner is in his 60’s known from extreme challenges – he’s finished more Badwater 135 races than anyone and climbed all the highest summits on the seven continents among a long list of other endurance achievements. Getting lost in the Gobi is a real possibility so runners are required to have a satellite phone and an additional GPS tracker that mounts to your pack. The Gobi Desert is particularly tough because of the temperature extremes, ranging from over 100 to below freezing. Making good decisions and taking care of your personal health is far more important that the typical marathon or ultra in American because help could be many hours away. We were told that they did have a drone that could deliver something to us if we had an emergency but I’m not sure on its range and didn’t want to test it out.</p>
<p>The terrain was insane, a never-ending obstacle course. The first day included sand, rocks, climbing, hopping fences, and uneven ground at every turn. Teaming up with another runner was always a plus. The first day I teamed up with Alfie, a Brit who was holding a strong pace with me in the top three leaders. I made some mistakes. First, I started too quickly. Not that an eight or nine-minute mile should seem too quick but you need to imagine 250 miles is a long way. It’s critical to get some rest, ample time to fill up with nutrition, and keep a calm enough pace that your muscles don’t seize up in the later half. When you are in the lead in this type of race early on it also takes more energy. The other runners are able to use the runners in front to get a better tangent with navigating.</p>
<p>The second day turned out to be the hottest of the trip and I got extremely ill in the middle of the hottest part of the day. It was a combination of pushing too hard to take the lead early, eating too large of a meal and choosing some poor combinations of drinks for my electrolytes. I was nearly knocked out of the race altogether. I crashed and burned. It took about all of my energy to reach a check point where there was a lone tent in the desert with a couple friendly Chinese. I felt so sick that I threw up repeatedly! I took refuge in the tent and waited for my body to rehydrate, gradually drinking a little each 10-15 minutes while attempting to nap. If I was in a typical city marathon in America I would have likely been prescribed an IV. I stayed the whole night at the check point and incurred a time penalty for stopping for longer than an hour at one of the check points. There were ten resting camps among the 36 check points where runners could stay longer if they wished. My goal of winning or finishing on the podium was out but I didn’t want to give up. I wasn’t sure if I could finish the race but I was going to give it everything I had. It would have been easy to quit given I didn’t feel half of my normal energy level and the challenge of being alone in a remote foreign land, but I edged onward.</p>
<p>The adventure was made greater by the friendly comradery of the local Chinese hired to support the race as well as my fellow competitors who came from such a varied background. The gauntlet of challenges never relented. I really enjoyed the areas where I would end up being able to take a 360-degree view and not see a soul or even the smallest remnant of civilization. Nature ruled and was omnipotent. There was an icy cold river crossing, temperatures over 100 and near freezing temperatures as we crossed the higher ranges in the night. Wind was so strong that if your hat blew off, it was lost. There was no way to chase it down with its speed. We climbed over a giant mountain that was over 10,000 feet and navigated through sand dunes. The backdrop was magical. Remote vistas few ever witness and we were covering the full terrain on foot. I would run into a panoramic view where as far as you could see was just flat desert. Occasionally, I would check my bearings with the GPS unit with a glance down, and just continue, alone with my thoughts. Finally, after an arduous journey I arrived to the blasting of fireworks at the Bridge of Champions in Guazhou City. A crowd of Chinese and media were there to welcome us. Finishers receive the second half of a Yangling Tiger Talley to the one they received before the start. It was used by Ancient Chinese Generals as a key and symbolically represents the honor of finishing. Just over half of the field finished including one female Veronique Messina, from France, who I enjoyed sharing some miles in the final stages of the race.</p>
<p>The Chinese were incredibly hospitable! I was hungry and exhausted! I was so thankful to go directly to a Chinese buffet after finishing. Following the experience everything was appreciated; especially communicated with my family, clean clothes, a bed, unlimited toilet paper, and more and more food. This is an advanced difficulty ultra. While one would want to run a number of prerequisites, I would highly recommend it. The Gobi Trail Ultra just happened to be exactly my 50<sup>th</sup> official ultra and the adventure of a lifetime.”</p>
<p>Harvey Lewis finished 11<sup>th</sup> overall in 120 hours, 43 minutes, and 34 seconds, wearing the same pair of <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-boco-at-ii"">Newton Boco II’s</a> for the entire race!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is simply #Extraordinary what Harvey Lewis is able to fit into a weeks’ time. On top of his weekly training miles, ranging from 50 to 120 miles a week, Harvey teaches high school social studies and also finds time to take people on running holidays with <a href=""http://www.runquesttravel.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.runquesttravel.com/', 'RunQuestTravel');"">RunQuestTravel</a>, the company he founded 4 years ago. He has been running marathons for 25 years and ultrarunning for over 20 years. Currently he is preparing for the 24 World Championships in Belfast, Ireland July, 2017 where he will run around the same loop for 24 hours!</p>
<p>Harvey has been teaching high school for 16 years and has been commuting (by running of course) to and from school for the last four of them. “I throw on my Newton’s and all my teacher supplies into a backpack and go! I strive to be an example to my students of how they can influence their own health and do their role to lesson our impact on the environment.”</p>
<p>Running has fueled Harvey’s desire to travel and “run the world.” His dream is to run in all 196 countries and experience the different terrain, environments and culture the world has to offer. He has crossed 83 countries off the list so far and plans to continue this #Extraordinary journey until he has visited all 196 of them.</p>
<p>When not travelling the world or teaching his high school students, Harvey picks up runs wherever he can. Whether it’s racing the Badwater 135 in Death Valley National Park, California with multiple nationalities, or jumping into a running group in Porto, Portugal or spontaneously joining a group of teenagers he bumps into running on the street in Ouarzazate, Moroco, he is always running. Running is a way of life for Harvey; and he has no plans of slowing down.</p>

				<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> Athlete and Chef, <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/justin-cogley/"">Justin Cogley</a> brings us a easy chicken salad recipe.</p>
<p>A great, light option after all of your filling holiday meals!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Roasted Chicken, Carrot, Buckwheat Croutons, Sorrel, and Gem lettuce Salad</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Ingredients</u></p>
<p><u>FOR THE ROAST CHICKEN</u></p>
<p>olive oil</p>
<p>1 free-range chicken</p>
<p>sea salt</p>
<p>freshly ground pepper</p>
<p>a small bunch of fresh thyme</p>
<p>1 lemon</p>
<p>3 cloves of garlic</p>
<p>*Makes 2 very large salads</p>
<p><u>FOR THE SALAD</u></p>
<p>1 buckwheat loaf (or multi grain loaf) unsliced</p>
<p>6 each baby heirloom carrots (sliced into rounds or lengthwise with a mandolin)</p>
<p>a handful of toasted hickory nuts</p>
<p>1 head of Gem lettuce or your favorite. Cleaned and torn into bite size pieces</p>
<p>extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p>2 tablespoon wholegrain mustard</p>
<p>quince vinegar or cider vinegar</p>
<p>a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked</p>
<p>a bunch of fresh mint , leaves picked</p>
<p>4 each scallions</p>
<p>a bunch of red veined sorrel</p>
<p><u>DIRECTIONS</u></p>
<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F Drizzle olive oil all over the chicken and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Put the thyme leaves in the butt of the chicken! Then halve the lemon and put it inside the cavity with the thyme stalks. Put the chicken onto a large roasting tray and cook in the oven for 1 hour 15 minutes or until the chicken is golden and the juices from the thigh run clear when pricked with a knife. (It all depends on how strong your oven game is, it could take less time)</p>
<p>Transfer the roasted chicken to a plate, cover with tin foil and leave to cool. Tear the bread into the roasting tray in thumb-sized torn croutons, then toss them in all the cooking juices from the chicken. Spread the croutons out in the tray. Pop back in the oven for around 15 to 18 minutes, or until everything is crispy and golden.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, remove all the chicken skin and set aside, then use two forks to strip every last bit of meat off the bone. Pile the meat into a large bowl and drizzle over any resting juices from the plate.</p>
<p>Next Add 6 tablespoons of good-quality extra virgin olive oil, the wholegrain mustard and a few good swigs of quince vinegar or cider vinegar. Chop up the parsley (leave some whole for presentation) and mint leaves and finely slice the scallions. Add them to the bowl. Next add the sliced carrots and hickory nuts.  Toss everything together, then have a taste and adjust with more vinegar or seasoning if you like.</p>
<p>Once the croutons are golden, quickly tear the chicken skin into the roasting tray (skip this if you want a healthier salad) and put back into the oven just until it crisps up again. When it’s looking crispy, Toss everything together with the gem lettuce and serve in the middle of the table.</p>

        <p>See below for an overview of what your training entails: <br><br>*Easy runs: These runs are meant to be a executed at a conversational pace and never higher than a 6-7 on a 1-10 scale with ten being the hardest. Try not to race yourself, your GPS or your training partner during easy runs. Save that for the days that include fast running! If you’re mindful of form (quick feet, tall posture, firm core, etc.), you can almost never run too slow for your easy runs, especially on those easy days for key speed sessions.</p><p>*Strides: These are simply short bursts of speed to help remind your body of what it’s like to run fast. Build into these efforts rather than going into a full sprint right off the bat. Gradually get faster until you’re at ~5K pace, or slightly faster, for the last few seconds of each stride. Maintain form and give yourself equal/greater rest to work for the duration of the strides that you’re doing…so if you’re doing 30-second strides, give yourself at least 30-seconds of easy running before starting the next one.</p><p>*Pace: This is your goal pace for the half marathon and you’ll see these efforts during your weekly long runs. You want to get accustomed to the pace at which you plan on running for the race.</p><p>*Speed work: You’ll notice 200s, 400s and 800s on your Wednesday speed sessions. These distances can also be substituted with 1/12 mile, ¼ mile, ½ mile respectively. 200s and 400s should be at 5K pace or slightly faster. For the 800s, you’ll want to target 10K pace or slightly faster. These do not have to be done on a track. These can be executed on the treadmill, road or track – whichever happens to be most convenient for you.</p><p>*Long runs: Long runs increase in distance from 7 miles in week one, to 12 miles in week seven, culminating with 13.1 miles for your race in week eight. You’ll notice that there’s often pace work during the second half of your long runs. This is to help keep you honest during the first part of your long runs so that you still have energy left at the end to finish strong. This should also help with your racing by teaching you how to pace yourself at the start and set you up for a fast finish.</p><p>*Tempo runs: These are runs designed for you to start easy, build your effort to between ½ marathon and 10K pace in the middle, then hold it for a mile or two before a brief cool down jog.</p><p>*10K Race: You have a lighter week in week four, and concludes with a 10K race to get you in the mindset of racing and to work on race strategy. The more you race, the better you get at it! If you can’t find a 10K race during week four, substitute it with a 7 mile tempo run.</p><p>*Strength: The exercises in these sessions are designed primarily for strength, stability and mobility in the targeted muscle groups, primarily focused in the hips. The exercises and loads are not meant to induce Delayed Onset of Muscle Soreness (DOMS) – that soreness you get in your muscles after a really hard workout. They are meant to complement your run training and keep you injury free. Along with easy runs, try not to overdo the strength training so that it negatively impacts future workouts a day or two later. See the video links for instructions.</p><p>*Foam Roll: Use this to self massage your muscles. You should never get to the point where it’s very uncomfortable. The goal is to find tender spots and gently try to smooth them out with the roller. Great areas to target are your calves, quads, hips and glutes.</p>

"<div class=""entry-content"" itemprop=""articleBody"">

			
				<p style=""text-align: center;"">By: <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/mackenzie-madison/"">Mackenzie Madison</a>, M.S. Exercise Physiology, USAT Level I Coach and <a href=""http://newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> Athlete</p>
<p>The beauty of endurance running is that for the most part you can virtually run anywhere in the world, in any weather. As runners we typically correlate our training periods to the seasons: winter is base, spring is speed with 5k’s and 10ks, summer brings half marathon’s and we end our season in the fall a.k.a. marathon and cross-country season.  Now that the 2017 winter is upon us, here are some tips from a “seasoned” (pun intended) pro on how to get the most out of your winter training.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Try to adjust your training schedule.</strong> It is the coldest (and dark) in the early morning hours in which many runners train. Temperatures rise throughout the day from the sun and start to plummet again in the evening once dark. Try to shift your training to over the lunch hour if you can. If you go into work earlier, take that extra time over your lunch break to get that run in! It’s safer in daylight as you will be able to see obstacles, avoid icy patches and others such as cars will be able to see you. Your body will also thank you for being able to exercise in warmer temperatures.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>Ditch the speed work.</strong> We all know that sprinters hate the cold and for good reason. Our body’s ability to have powerful muscular contractions decreases with decreasing temperature. Our body functions at an optimum temperature level- too cold or too hot and we see performance decreases, not to mention the exponential increase in injury associated with cold weather speed sessions. Trying to add speed on top of tip-toeing your way over an icy patch or worse- not knowing its there and slamming to the ground doesn’t sound like a great, quality speed session. Best to save the speed work for warmer days and inside.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Layer right.</strong> Layering is the most important principle to consider when gathering the right running apparel. The goal is to cover exposed skin, but to also create separate air pockets so that the outdoor cold elements do not adhere to our bodies and clothing. Layering with your base layer wicks up your sweat. The next layer is either an additional long-sleeve warming to protect the wet layer from hitting the cold and cooling you down too much or to create an additional barrier under an outer jacket that protects from wind. IF you live in a windy area get a Gortex material outer jacket or a fabric that creates wind-stopping resistance. All of your base layers need to be moisture wicking to prevent your clothing from getting too damp and causing the body to chill. Your socks should be moisture wicking as well such as wool running socks. Avoid cotton running apparel at all costs as it is the worst type of material to wear- especially in the winter. Dress as if it is 20 degrees warmer outside when considering your running layers. This should prevent overdressing. Most importantly wear some colored materials so you will be seen. Winter is not a time individuals see runners as much so make sure to be seen to be safe. Chances are most of you aren’t going to be able to run over the lunch hour so running early in the morning or at night after work can create a tremendous risk for drivers not being able to see you. Wear a headlamp or carry a flashlight and wear protective gear.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong>Winterize your shoes</strong>. Winter brings snow and ice and in general can create a lot more moisture on the ground. Start by taking more measures to waterproof your shoes. Perhaps get a specific water-repellent shoe for your winter training to keep your feet warm and happy and running for miles. My favorite tried and true trail and winter running shoe is the Boco Sol. Also consider ordering a half a size up if you intend on wearing thicker moisture-wicking wool socks as well. Not just Cars can hydroplane and skid on ice, so can you! To prevent skidding and sliding and even worse- wiping out get yourself a pair of yak tracks or some DIY hexagonal screw spikes to prevent being victim to the ice.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong>Plan your route.</strong> What was once your easy, go-to route in the summer may no longer be so easy, you will most likely have to alter your training routes. Rule of thumb is to avoid running in the shade or covered areas as they pose the biggest threat of uneven ground, objects, ice and water puddles. When running in the winter, I suggest you focus on trail routes that have less traffic. Try to run in loops, as it is very beneficial in extreme weather conditions- cold or hot. Running in loops during the winter allows you to take off extra items of clothing if you get too hot or to stop if it’s downright too cold to run. By running in loops, this will also give you access to hydration or to create a hydration stash since water fountains are off during the winter. Hydration is just as important in the winter as it is in the summer, with even dryer air in the cooler months.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""6"">
<li><strong>Pay attention to the wind.</strong> We all know that if we are inside on the treadmill it’s a lot warmer if there’s no fan and it feels a heck of a lot better when you feel the air conditioning kick on in a fitness center. Wind is natures natural cooling system. So even if the temperature is 28 degrees outside, the wind chill can make it feel like a brutal 18 degrees outside. Even if you dress in the correct number of layers, the wind can penetrate your running apparel and remove the warm layer between your body and clothing. This is why it is imperative to utilize a gortex layer outer shell jacket to protect yourself from the wind. To decrease the wind’s cooling power, run into the wind first while you are working up a sweat and then run back with the wind to keep yourself warm after you have started sweating for awhile.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""7"">
<li><strong>Warm up before your run.</strong> Our core temperature changes throughout the day. Our bodies coldest temperature happens during deep, early morning sleep and when we first awake. (It’s no wonder why everything feels a lot colder in the morning.) The reason that this happens is because your body has not redistributed the blood from your core to your extremities yet. This is why it’s important to warm up before you start your training- especially in the morning and especially during the winter months. Drink some hot tea or coffee, stretch in front of a heater or fire, try to warm up and increase your core temperature inside before heading out. It’s also important to complete a longer warm up during the cold winter months. Forgive your body and don’t force quicker running paces on it too soon, or you’ll be asking for a strained muscle or injury.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""8"">
<li><strong>Half outside half inside</strong>. On those speed workout days consider running your warm up and cool down outside, while completing your main intensity set inside. This will help vary up your scenery, but will also will get in your quality running safely while still getting in some outdoor mileage. If you question if it’s too cold outside to run you can always try it out for your warmup and finish the rest of your workout inside. Departing from the fitness center gives you options for your training and allows you to change out of wet clothes and shower immediately, instead of driving home in chilled, damp workout apparel.  Just remember to bring layers to prepare for whatever weather you will encounter.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""9"">
<li><strong>Dreadmill it.</strong> When it really isn’t going to warm up- there is no point in being a hero. Sometimes it’s just darn right dangerous to be out in the cold. Your risk of injury or hypothermia increases dramatically. When you run you produce sweat and with dangerously low temperatures it’s best to keep inside or better yet- treat your body to an extra recovery day. A good rule of thumb is never to go outside when the wind chill is below 20 or the temperature is below zero. Sometimes it’s just best to stay inside.</li>

				<h1>Part Three</h1>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">What was the best and worst part of running the Grand Canyon?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Kara – </span><span style=""color: #333333;"">The best part was running down the canyon at 4am into complete darkness with a bunch of crazy awesome chicks. There was just this epic sense of adventure and an incredible feeling of excitement. And nothing hurt yet which was a plus. The worst part was the complete loss of skin on the top of both feet. After running in the rain for 7 hours it seems that my skin gave up and abandoned ship. It looks like my feet have been boiled. Seriously…I can’t put shoes on.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Cody – I don’t know if I could pin point that. The day was a total adventure from start to finish, the scenery was epic, the terrain was incredibly challenging, both mentally and physically. I guess the best part is the memories that we have from the entire day. It was truly the adventure of a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Sabina – To be honest the day was full of epic highs and major lows for me. The worst part for me was from mile 31-38 lets just say I was in pretty bad shape…soaking wet, in pain, and with 6 hours to go. The best part… well there are so many moments that come to mind but what really made it all worth it was at mile 45 the sky’s cleared and this amazing rainbow shot out from the middle of the Grand Canyon, it was a good friend saying hello. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Would you do it again?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Kara – Maybe. It was an incredible experience but I’m ready for something new! What’s the next grand adventure going to be??</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Cody – You know, I think running the Grand Canyon should be a bucket list run, that said… I checked it off my list and have no plans of going back</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Sabina – I think that question is tricky.  If you asked me at mile 40 I would say NEVER AGAIN! But looking back on it now Never say Never. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Any Advice for someone wanting to run R2R2R?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Kara – Be prepared for changes in weather. We were very happy that we packed rain gear and an extra base layer when 7 hours of thunderstorms rolled in.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Don’t forget to eat! The easiest way to bonk is by forgetting to eat. Even if you don’t feel hungry, keep that food coming. We each packed a variety of snacks from pizza rolls to Fig Newtons, GUs and everything in between. You never know what you’ll end up craving so the more options the better!</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Remember, it always gets better. No matter how terrible you’re feeling, things will turn around and you’ll be laughing at the meltdown you’re having in no time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Lastly, don’t forget to enjoy the views, laugh and have fun. This is supposed to be fun, even if it may not feel like it all the time. If you’re not enjoying it, then why even bother!</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Cody – Definitely plan out the route you’re taking. The Grand Canyon is a total beast and if you get down there unprepared you still have to somehow make it back out. Plan on having extreme low points and extreme high points – if you’re expecting that roller coaster of emotions, it’s much easier to deal with. Lastly, know where the water stops are and plan to bring a variety of things to eat so you don’t get flavor fatigue. Oh and definitely bring a poncho. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333;"">Sabina – YES! Knowing what I know now I would have done a lot of things a little different. 1) Don’t underestimate the Grand Canyon and mother nature, ITS A BEAST!  2) Train on the steepest mountain you can find, hike up it and run down over and over! 3) Enjoy every moment of it even if you are miserable because its EPIC! Good Luck 🙂</span></p>

<p><strong>JT PEEBLES</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Have you run the Boston Marathon before?  If so, how many times? </em></strong></p>
<p>I have returned every year since 2013 and will be running my 4th consecutive Boston Marathon this year.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the hardest part of the course for you?</em></strong></p>
<p>The hardest part of the course for me is cresting Heartbreak Hill and pushing through to the final miles. In this stretch there usually isn’t as much crowd support and it gets very mentally tough to hold pace.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does Boston differ from other Marathons? </em></strong></p>
<p>I’m just as excited as the first time because nothing is quite like the Boston experience. The entire city is very encouraging, friendly, and extremely helpful when they find out you are in town to race.</p>
<p><strong><em>How and where did you qualify? </em></strong></p>
<p>My friend Seth and I decided to race the Dallas White Rock Marathon in December as fast as possible. We set the goals of breaking 3 hours for my first marathon and beating my mom’s all-time marathon PR of 2:58:58 which happened to be on the same course 23 years earlier. Race day came again and brought steady rain in 40 degree temperatures. I gave it my all and crossed the finish line in 2:59:13, which qualified me for the Boston Marathon, but was 15 seconds shy of my mom’s PR. She lovingly laughed and said, “Don’t worry, baby…  You’ll knock it down soon enough.”</p>
<p><strong><em>What is your favorite part of Marathon weekend? </em></strong></p>
<p>Other than all of the race day hype, my favorite part about the weekend is interacting with other athletes from all experience levels and backgrounds to swap stories of their journey to Boston. I can’t count all the fun conversations I’ve had with other racers and their families over the years.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you train for Heartbreak Hill and the last miles of the race? </em></strong></p>
<p>In preparations for this year I have taken a different approach and have used Pete Pfitzinger’s Advanced Marathoning book. I hope that this will see me through the last quarter of the race with more endurance and strength than years prior. My goal is to run just under 2:55 in my new Distance V’s. It’s taken hard work, but I feel stronger than ever and thank the Lord for being out there with me every day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-5545"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog-hoover.jpg"" alt=""blog-hoover"" width=""720"" height=""450"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog-hoover.jpg 720w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog-hoover-300x188.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px""></p>
<p><strong>ALISON HOOVER</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Have you run the Boston Marathon before?  If so, how many times?</em></strong></p>
<p>This will be my 3rd consecutive year running the Boston Marathon, and Goldilocks is hoping that this time is the charm! Conditions are never predictable, nor are they controllable, but after one “too hot”, and one “too wet”, here’s hoping this one is just right. I know, as most runners do, that running is a privilege, and it can be taken away in an instant or hindered by that injury that always lurks around the next corner. I feel fortunate enough just to have the opportunity to have made it this far, and as a result I try to give every race my all, because you never know if you’ll get the chance to do it again.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the hardest part of the course for you?</em></strong></p>
<p>No matter the weather, the hardest part of the Boston course for me isn’t so much the course itself, but the fact that you are packed in the corrals like sardines, and it doesn’t thin out like other large marathons. Every sardine there is a fast runner, because they had to be in order to qualify, so you don’t get to clear any space for yourself, and run elbow to elbow (to elbow) for many miles. For me, this is a challenge as I don’t do well in crowds. The first six miles are slightly downhill, and normally this is where I would get a bit of a “jump” as I love downhill running. In fact, in my first attempt at the race, my qualifying time landed me in a later wave, but in the first corral. There was a bit of a gap between Wave 2 and 3, and for a few miles I was one of 6 or 7 women running out front, wind in our hair, feeling like we were Shalane Flanagan (or in my case my hero, Lanni Marchant). It was the first year after the bombing, and the course was lined with military as well as families with small children, and you felt the need to high-five every single one of them for being brave enough to stand out there, and you did.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does Boston differ from other Marathons?</em></strong></p>
<p>When race day arrives, it also feels a little different than other races. We all know that a marathon is 26.2 miles, but there is something about the endless bus ride to the start line in this point to point race that makes it feel more like fifty There is a huge amount of nervous tension on the bus, as well as an air of celebration, and it comes in the form of every accent and language, and you realize how far everyone has traveled just to be there. The course itself also has a huge air of celebration. Each neighborhood has its own flavor and you never feel that you are out there alone. There are of course the official water and aide stops along the route, but there are also seasoned crowds cheering for you who bring their own aide to the course at just the right places: be it a popsicle, an orange segment, or even a kiss. You feel like the crowds are there for you, and they are enjoying themselves and are proud of their cities and their race, and you feel the need to thank every one of them, and you do.</p>
<p><strong><em>How and where did you qualify? </em></strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t until the final mile of the Mercedes Marathon in 2013 when I saw my family and they yelled at me “Mommy, if you hurry, you could go to Boston”, that that seed was planted. I had heard of the Boston Marathon, but really didn’t understand the whole process of qualifying, let alone actually wanting to run that far ever again. It turned out that I missed it by one minute, and suddenly a goal that was never on my radar, was born. A few minutes on the internet looking at charts with age groups and times, and this whole qualifying thing became clear, and I signed up for another one six months later with an actual goal time in mind. I qualified for this Boston with my fastest time of a 3:25 at a downhill race in Utah, called Big Cottonwood. It is a gorgeous course, and is my favorite marathon to date. You start at an elevation of 8000 feet with cool temps and the smell of Christmas trees, and run down towards Salt Lake City, and at mile five, you might just run by a moose.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is your favorite part of Marathon weekend?</em></strong></p>
<p>The atmosphere around the expo and outside on the finish line feels different than other races, and as my husband once pointed out, it can be a little intimidating because every single runner there is fit. Really fit.  At most marathons you will see every shape and size of runner, but as you walk around Boston you start thinking that every single person you see is an elite runner and that you should ask for an autograph, because quite frankly they all look as if they could be. When you do your shake-out runs down by the water, you are actually running with (okay, near) the elite runners, because everyone feels a little anonymous there without their bibs, and everyone is preparing in the same way, no matter what the pace. And as you are running your easy three miles, you might say to your husband, “Isn’t that Meb running towards us?”, and it is, and he gives you a high-five when you timidly stick your hand out.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you train for Heartbreak Hill and the last miles of the race?</em></strong></p>
<p>I do most of my training in Birmingham AL, where we have no shortage of hills, so the hills of Boston are not the challenging part of the course for me. The late start, the crowded field, and the warm temps that go along with the late start are the conditions that create the biggest hurdles for me, but they also create the excitement that makes the Boston marathon different from the others. So much training and effort has already been applied to the process of even qualifying, that the actual running of those 26.2 miles somehow feels like your reward, because you feel like you have earned it. The company that I work for emphasizes the process of goal setting, as well as planning out the smaller steps that help you to realize that goal, so when you arrive in Boston, and receive that coveted bib at packet pick-up, there is already a feeling of some accomplishment, even though you haven’t run a step of the course yet.</p>

<p><strong>JEFF GALFORD</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Have you run the Boston Marathon before?  If so, how many times?</em></strong></p>
<p>This is my first Boston Marathon and plan to run this race often in the future. I’ve been running for 16 years.  Over the last four years, I dedicated myself to be the best endurance athlete I can be. One of my goals was to run the Boston Marathon. I’m now excited to complete that goal by running the Boston marathon on April 18, 2016.</p>
<p><em> </em><strong><em>How does Boston differ from other Marathons?</em></strong></p>
<p>Boston is such a prestigious race. Anyone who’s not familiar with running or marathon running knows Boston. I think the most frequent question to a marathon runner is: Have you run Boston? I believe that’s why Boston is different than most races. As a runner, you are defined by qualifying and running Boston.</p>
<p><strong><em>How and where did you qualify?</em></strong></p>
<p>I consider the Carlsbad Marathon my home race. I train there all the time and know the area very well.  The race started off a little behind schedule; there was an 8 – 10 minute delay. I was a little frustrated initially, because I was mentally focused to start at 6:15 a.m. but I think the late start actually helped me to relax a bit. I started the race well and at a slow, steady pace. After the 3rd mile, my legs started warming up nicely and for the rest of race, I was able to run at a comfortable pace. I listened to my body and controlled my breathing the entire race. I finished the race strong and didn’t injury myself in the process. I placed 18th Overall and 2nd in my Age Division. This is where I qualified for the Boston Marathon.</p>
<p><em> </em><strong><em>What is your favorite part of Marathon weekend?</em></strong></p>
<p>I enjoy catching up with old friends and meeting new ones. By far the most exciting part of the marathon weekend is the start. I enjoy the heart-pumping nervousness and adrenaline rush. It’s the feeling of the unknown once the horn is sounded. The thought that always pops into my head while the horn is sounding is: “Why am I doing this again??? “.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you train for Heartbreak Hill and the last miles of the race? </em></strong></p>
<p>My marathon cycle starts 24 weeks before the race.  Once I build a broad aerobic base, I go into a four-week hill training phase. I do two hill workouts a week focusing on good knee lift, posture and arm swing. I don’t run too fast or hard up the hill but slowly for resistance. My duration for the workout is about one hour plus a 15 min. warm up and cool down. I’m always running on rolling hills in the San Diego area.</p>
<p>I simulated the last miles of the race by purposely running on empty. I keep my run to one hour and keep the run at a high aerobic pace or zone 2. The workout is reverse of an out and back which the goal is to try to have a negative split. I run the opposite: I try to have a positive split and to get to the edge of bonking on the second half of my run.</p>

<p><strong>TAYLOR HANNEGAN</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Have you run the Boston Marathon before?  If so, how many times?</em></strong></p>
<p>This will be my first time running the Boston Marathon, and only the second marathon I’ve ever run.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the hardest part of the course for you? </em></strong></p>
<p>At this point, the hardest part of the course (and the race in general) is going to be the unknown. I’m coming off a slight injury, but also much more consistent and structured training than my first marathon. I have some idea about what to expect on Marathon Monday, but it’s also going to be wildly different than my first marathon which makes it a completely new race to me.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does Boston differ from other Marathons?</em></strong></p>
<p>Based on my impressions (and anecdotes from some of my team) one of the biggest differences is the energy and the atmosphere. I’ve been told that it’s unlike almost any other race, and that there are crowds along the entirety of the course. In some ways, it sounds like it’s going to be similar to the Bolder Boulder, only a whole lot longer.</p>
<p><strong><em>How and where did you qualify? </em></strong></p>
<p>I qualified at the Denver Rock and Roll Marathon back in October of 2014. It was an interesting experience, to say the least. I signed up five weeks ahead of time; I was in good shape, but my longest run in the six months leading up to signing up was no more than 10 miles. I called it my “Couch-to-Marathon-in-5-Weeks” training plan. I did three runs over 10 miles leading up to the marathon (yes, I knew how much of a mistake that was, even at the time. I’m young and invincible though!) but also had it in my mind that if I were going to run a marathon, I was going to qualify for Boston. The race went about as expected; I felt awesome for the first 10 miles, good for the next 10, and just tried to survive the last 6. I even started sobbing coming down the finishing chute because I knew I had qualified.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is your favorite part of Marathon weekend? </em></strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I’m really excited for the race itself. My parents and my grandmother are all coming to watch me, and my office is having a viewing party (I’ll be those three pixels in blue with my bright orange shoes!). I have a lot of people supporting me, which is an awesome feeling. I feel like I’ve put in much more training and effort preparing for the race, so it’s going to be totally different than my first time running a marathon. That, and the after-party at Fenway Park!</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you train for Heartbreak Hill and the last miles of the race? </em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve been doing hill repeats for some of my hard workouts, and it’s tough to do a long run here in Boulder without climbing at least a few hills. It’s definitely going to help coming from altitude as well. Combine that with the crowds, atmosphere, and adrenaline that will come with the race and I’m hoping I’ll cruise through the last part instead of just surviving!</p>

				<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">You know him as a world-class athlete and eight-time Olympic medalist and speedskater (and possibly even from Dancing with the Stars), what about as a triathlete? Only Kona will tell. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">You know his face: brown eyes, the soul patch and signature wavy hair with the bandana tied around his head. Apolo Ohno is a global icon and athlete on the ice and is an internationally known face of short-track speedskating. In 2010, after making sports history by becoming the most decorated U.S. Winter Olympian of all-time, Ohno hung up his competitive skates.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Retirement doesn’t always come easy to such high caliber athletes—Ohno likes to and needs to be busy and always learning or pushing himself.  By the time he retired he already had his hand in many businesses, not to mention he was a brand in his own right traveling the world regularly for speaking engagements. “I live for that pumped state of learning,” says Ohno. So naturally when the opportunity arose to train for the IRONMAN World Championship in Kona, he jumped at it. And, unlike most of us who train and then maybe try a sprint or Olympic distance triathlon first, Ohno chose the IRONMAN 70.3 Boise (half the distance of Kona)  to be his first triathlon ever. Finishing in 4.57, he has only done one sprint triathlon since then.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">With Kona just days away on October 11, we caught up with Ohno at his home in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo.jpg""><span style=""color: #000000;""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-5082"" alt=""Apolo"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo-1024x682.jpg"" width=""625"" height=""416"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo-624x416.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">1.  We know that you ran the New York Marathon in 2011 in a time of 3:25.  What was your experience with cycling and swimming before training for Kona?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Okay, first of all, immediately after the New York marathon I stopped running. At that time I was doing a lot of weight training, kickboxing, and training with some NFL athletes out east.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">For speedskating, we would bike in the summers as a team, but nowhere near the volume required for an IRONMAN. We did short bursts. And swimming, that has been nonexistent in my life since I was 12 years old.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> <strong>2. We know you’re a busy guy, so what does your training routine look like?</strong>     </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Paula Newby-Fraser has been my rock. Paula is the queen of Kona and perhaps one of the best coaches I have ever worked with in my life. My training has been dictated by her—she puts me on a weekly schedule. Sometimes I’ll go down and train with her in Carlsbad, but mostly I train by myself because I have such a busy schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Today, I have a 2.5 hour bike ride, followed by a 45 minute run off the bike. The training has cut back as we get closer to Kona. I got really sick about 11 days ago, really sick. So now we’re bringing my body back up. But it’s different every day. Yesterday I had a swim.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">I needed this in my life, to re-test myself, to have a change and a challenge that is taking me out of my comfort zone and putting every element of my body to the test.  It was like hitting the “reset” button on my body’s athletic memory, except with different physical challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> <strong>3. Have you noticed any big physical changes in your body since you’ve been training?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">I haven’t lifted any weights since I’ve been training for this. I’ve leaned down. Do I look like a triathlete? I probably never will. I carry a lot of muscle mass.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> <strong>4. Are there any similarities between speedskating and triathlon training and racing?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">They both hurt, that’s about it. My speed-skating races lasted 40 seconds long. I trained to produce the most amount of energy in the shortest amount of time, starting from a very static, loaded position. Triathlon is a continuous non-stop aerobic activity. It was a huge change and still is a huge change.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> <strong>5. What’s on your training playlist?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">I like a wide variety of music—house music when I’m out for a long ride. I like to just get into a rhythm and lose track of time. A Gareth Emery podcast or Above and Beyond podcast.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> <strong>6. What is the biggest thing you’ve had to wrap your head around?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo34.jpg""><span style=""color: #000000;""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5085"" alt=""Apolo34"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo34.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""480"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo34.jpg 640w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo34-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apolo34-624x468.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px""></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">The biggest thing is the fact that the training is so different. On a Saturday morning, getting up early to do a 100-mile bike ride followed by a run and being done at 1 in the afternoon. The time consumption is difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">And then, in Kona, what the weather will be like. Everyone says it’s beautiful, but the conditions are very hot and humid and there are 40-mile crosswinds in the bike. There are people clamoring over you in the swim and then running a full marathon after that whole day with ambient temperatures at 120-plus. How do I get through that?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> <strong>7. In speedskating there is this unknown, you train and train and then in the race someone can slide into you and take you out…what is that unknown you’re worried about at Kona?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">This is the most coveted endurance event on the planet. It puts your mind and physical being to the test. Everyone says there is a breaking point where you think about how you should stop and you have to push through that. There is that potential you won’t finish. I accept the challenge and I have a great team. I’ll give it my best.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> 8. You’ve already succeeded at the top as far as athletics go, is there anything you’ve learned from this experience that you didn’t expect?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">I have been surprised at the entire triathlon community and how people welcome you with open arms. I’ve been welcomed with open arms. I had no idea how big triathlon is and how many personalities are involved in it—it’s awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> <strong>9. So you run in Newtons—how long have you been running in Newtons and why Newtons?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">I have been wearing Newtons since I started training for triathlon. I wore traditional shoes before. As soon as I started to run more, people encouraged me to try them. When I put them on, I said, ‘Why haven’t I heard about them before?’ Newtons make sense. The Newton team established themselves as a premier running company based on performance, dynamics, and relationships with athletes. They have this cult following. They care and understand the science of running and are interested in making you run better. I plan on running in Newtons for the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">10.You visited the Newton Running Lab and worked with Newton Co-founder Danny Abshire. How did that go?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">When I went to the running lab in Boulder, it was awesome, talking to everyone who works in the store, doing the running analysis. Danny makes running seem like walking, like it’s natural. He has a way of explaining running that makes you want to run.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">11.You noted that you have been working with Newton athlete and coach Paula Newby-Fraser as well. How has that been? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">It’s been amazing. Her ability to transfer her knowledge as an athlete to a novice like myself, and her database of knowledge is incredible. She is a great coach. She understands the body, the physiology of training, recovery, and nutrition. She has all of the elements locked in.  She could coach any sport – she is that good and that smart!</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">12.What’s the most valuable advice she’s passed on to you?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apolo1.jpg""><span style=""color: #000000;""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5083"" alt=""apolo1"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apolo1.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apolo1.jpg 768w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apolo1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apolo1-624x832.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px""></span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Adapt, adapt adapt—whatever the situation is always know you have to adapt and make small adjustments along the way.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">13.What advice do you have for others who are considering doing a triathlon, an IRONMAN or otherwise? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">I think nutrition is a huge part of it and consistency of training. You can’t make up training if you miss it, you can’t just jump back in and be back where you were, you have to put in the time. There is time on your feet, on the saddle, and in the pool, and you can’t replace that.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">It has been hard and eye opening. A lot of people who do this sport have normal lives. There is only a small amount of athletes that just train. I have a whole lot of respect for the people who do this who have kids and families and work, that’s the thing that is inspirational about triathlon, and to see how much they dedicate to the sport. It’s cool.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">14.When it’s done will you hang up the bike and your swim trunks or keep going? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">I don’t think I’ll just hang it up right away, I’ll continue to do some training. I really enjoy the IRONMAN triathlon world—I like being a part of it. I don’t see myself going away, but I will definitely look for new challenges.</span></p>

				<p><strong>Continuing our series spotlighting Newton runners who go the distance, today we feature Newton Ultra Runner Harvey Lewis and the Des Sables Marathon. The Des Sables Marathon, or MdS, is actually the equivalent of roughly five and a half marathons over five days in the Sahara Desert in Morocco. MdS has been ranked by the Discovery Channel as the toughest footrace on earth! </strong><strong>Harvey will toe the starting line there this weekend. Per iRunFar, Lewis is </strong><strong>one of Top-10 Challengers to the podium to watch!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We recently caught up with Harvey to learn about his training and racing habits. We wish him luck and we’ll be watching him over the 7-day stage race!</strong></p>
<h1>Harvey Lewis</h1>
<p><em>Harvey Lewis is a great example of how hard work enables you to follow and achieve your dreams. Growing up, Harvey struggled with childhood obesity. He stumbled upon track in eighth grade and he loved the way he felt when he was running. The next year he signed up for the Cleveland Marathon, despite the strong doubts of his teammates. He finished but it wasn’t pretty and Harvey will tell you it was tougher than he had ever dreamed. His passion for running continued but Harvey never won a race until June 2004. That same year, he broke his neck in a car accident. After the near death experience, neurosurgeons rebuilt his 4th and 5th vertebra, with added titanium implants. It took a year and a half to get to the speed he once was, yet Harvey’s running took on a new force. Harvey qualified for the Boston marathon after seventeen years of running the distance. He earned a spot on Team USA for the World Championship. And, he went on to win the Badwater 135. Here’s more about from Harvey about how his training and racing habits drive him to accomplish his dreams.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What does your training look like? </em></strong></p>
<p>When I first began competitive ultrarunning, I ran roughly fifty miles per week but that number has increased over time. Last year I averaged eighty eight miles per week and this year I’m over hundred for the first three months of the year!</p>
<p>In order to incorporate my training into a busy lifestyle of being a full time teacher I run 10k each day to work. I usually get my best speed work in when I’m running late- I fly! Typically my training varies on the next big race, for example the Badwater 135, a 135 mile race across a desert, entails training in heat and running hill repeats. Regardless of what is coming I aim to include speed work at least once per week.</p>
<p>I absolutely see the value of tracking your data. I coach a select number of ultrarunners and always emphasize that tracking their progress is important. Personally, I’m old school and use a pocket calendar; I calculate my weekly and monthly mileage as well as the distance of each run. I also record if there was something significant about a run- whether it was hilly, hot, or a speed session. Recording data helps me compare my training over the years and keeps me motivated to improve my personal bests.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about nutrition?</em></strong></p>
<p>I credit much of my success in ultrarunning to a stomach that enables me to devour tons of food and start running instantly. I have been a vegetarian for twenty years and it has made a significant impact on my overall health.</p>
<p>Prior to a race, I like to eat oatmeal and fruit or cereal with almond milk. During a race I like to eat Clifbar gels, shotblocks and electrolyte drinks. I will also eat salty chips or crackers, and enjoy cookies or cheese pizza. Post-race I like to go a buffet as an incentive for giving my full effort. After the Badwater 135, I crave a giant all you can eat salad bar, largely because I’ve been consuming unprecedented amounts of sugars and my body craves something healthy.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are your upcoming races?</em></strong></p>
<p>Marathon Des Sables (Morocco) April, 2016</p>
<p>Pacing Whistler Half Marathon (Canada) June, 2016</p>
<p>Mohican 100 miler (Ohio, USA) June, 2016</p>
<p>RunQuest Travel Tour (Portugal/Spain/Estonia/Finland) July, 2016</p>
<p>Badwater 135 (California, USA) July, 2016</p>
<p>24 Hour National Championship (Ohio, USA) September, 2016</p>

				<h1><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>As you contemplate your New Year’s Resolution, consider taking inspiration from amateur triathlete Dan Stubleski.</strong></span></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>While you contemplate your New Year’s Resolutions, consider taking inspiration from Dan Stubleski, who didn’t run, swim or bike competitively until he took up triathlons four years ago at age 34. Although he now rides with a local team (Fraser Bicycle Team Green), he doesn’t have a coach and he works full time. Still, this year, he placed first in his division (35-39) at the Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii and he was the overall top amateur finisher, in a time of 8:50:22. We caught up with him recently at his home in Washington, Michigan, where he lives with his wife (who he describes as “the best Sherpa EVER!!!!”) and two kids, ages 12 and 10.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DanKona1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-5144"" alt=""DanKona1"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DanKona1-1024x768.jpg"" width=""625"" height=""468"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DanKona1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DanKona1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DanKona1-624x467.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Before you started doing triathlons had you ever raced running? </span></strong>No, no racing before. I just ran for fun. I was competitive in team sports.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Did you bike or race bikes?</strong></span> My first race was the South Maui Triathlon in 2011.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>What about swimming? </strong></span> I knew how to swim, for fun, but did not start really swimming until I signed up for the South Maui Tri. I started swimming at the Romeo High School pool.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>So triathlons are quite a bit different than playing basketball. How did you start doing triathlons? </strong></span>Well, I bought my first road bike because I was into watching the Tour De France and thought that riding might be fun. I bought my first road bike and loved it. I discovered Triathlon when looking for a bike race during a trip to Maui with my wife in June of 2011. We were already booked to go and I wanted to bring my bike. I thought it would be cool to do a race while I was there, but could only find triathlon and not just bike racing. I figured why not? I’ll try it!</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>You came 2<sup>nd</sup> in your first triathlon, the South Maui Tri, which was Olympic Distance,  and then went straight to the IRONMAN Steelhead 70.3 in Michigan…were you hooked after the first one and just decided to go for it?</strong></span> Oh heck yeah, I was hooked! I figured I did well at the Olympic distance, and loved it, and Steelhead was within driving distance, so why not?</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>When did you set your sites on a full IRONMAN?</strong></span> I did not set my sites on IRONMAN until after I completed the 70.3 (which actually wasn’t a true 70.3 because the swim was cancelled).</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Looking at your resume, it looks like you performed well from the get go and then just got stronger? Were you surprised at your performance? </strong></span> I was surprised at my performance in Maui. I really just wanted to finish. I never expected to finish second overall! It wasn’t until after like my 3rd or 4th race that I stopped being surprised and knew that triathlon racing must be my thing.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Was IRONMAN Texas your first full?</strong></span> Yes, Texas 2013.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>When did you set your sites on Kona? </strong></span>After my 2012 race season—I raced well in 2012 and set my sites on a full IRONMAN and qualifying for Kona 2013.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>In 2013, you placed 2<sup>nd</sup> in your age group and 26<sup>th</sup> overall at Kona. How did that race rank for you in your list of experiences? I</strong></span> think I have to say my best race experience was Kona 2013, my first time racing there. There is nothing like it! Just the feeling of being in Kona was awesome—the crazy, exciting atmosphere. Just standing on the pier. Crossing the finish line for the first time in Kona, the feeling is indescribable!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1824.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-5146"" alt=""IMG_1824"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1824-819x1024.jpg"" width=""625"" height=""781"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1824-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1824-239x300.jpg 239w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1824-624x780.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>What were your goals heading to Kona this year?</strong></span> My goal was to win! Isn’t that always the goal? Lol! I also wanted to improve on my marathon time.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>What were you worried about going in?</strong></span> If I could improve on my time from last year.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Did you know you were the first amateur?</strong></span> I did know I was in first. It was close for most of the race. Toward the end though I knew I had a little time on the second place guy.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Obviously, you won, so the race went well. What were the highlights? </strong></span>Well, I had a bad swim. I picked a spot that proved to be not good! It was crowded. Everybody wants to be first so everybody wants to start the swim up front. The spot I chose was crowded for most of the swim. My favorite part was the bike. I love to ride. I got a new Specialized Shiv this season and sometimes I just can’t get out of the saddle!!! My bike was descent, considering there was a head wind heading to Hawi and pretty much all the way back from Hawi! I had a PR on the run, 2:58:19. I was excited, happy, proud! I couldn’t believe I had done it!</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Was your family there to watch?</strong></span> This year just my wife, but last year for my first Kona, my wife and kids were all there.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>And you raced in Newtons? </strong></span>Yes I did. I raced in the Elites, the green ones. When I first started wearing Newtons I wore Distance S. I sometimes still train in them.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Why Newtons? </strong></span>Honestly, because Crowie [Newton athlete/triathlete Craig Alexander] wears them! That is how I discovered them. I was wearing another brand for my 2011 season and they were too wide, sloppy. I knew that before my 2012 season I needed to find a new brand. I saw Crowie in Newtons and looked them up and thought I’d give them a try. I have been hooked on them ever since. Love them. The guys that work in the Newton tent at the race venues got to know my wife because we were in there shopping so much!</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>So, why do you do what you do? </strong></span>I do it because I love it. I love to exercise. It makes me feel alive! Lol, most people don’t understand that!</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>What do people think back home?</strong></span> Everyone is excited. Everyone is happy for me and they want to hear my Kona story, which I am happy to tell!</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>What’s next?</strong></span> Well, I had a lot to think about and consider. I kind of wanted to go pro, but with the changes to the pro race that Ironman made, it really doesn’t make sense for me. All of the sold out races that I could have entered and close to home races are no longer pro races. So, I am going to stay amateur.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Do you have any advice for newcomers to triathlon? </strong></span>For the newcomers in the sport, start slow and enjoy the journey. It takes a lot of dedication to do this sport. It gets a little easier the fitter you get.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>What about any New Year’s Resolutions? </strong></span>My goal for the year is to go faster each time I race. To win again in Kona would be awesome!! We will see. I think I can still improve in all areas.</p>

				<p>When award-winning Chef, <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/pages/athletes/justin-cogley/"">Justin Cogley</a>, won an entry to the Big Sur Marathon, he wasn’t a runner. He is now.</p>
<p>Justin Cogley had always been an athlete. But then life as a chef kind of got in the way. Until last year, when the award-winning Cogley, who is Executive Chef at Aubergine Restaurant at L’Auberge Carmel (in Carmel, California), won an entry into the Big Sur marathon. He wasn’t a runner. Encouraged (and heckled a bit) by his colleagues, the 36-year-old Cogley decided to do it.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Justin1.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5177"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Justin1.png"" alt=""Justin1"" width=""474"" height=""470"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Justin1.png 474w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Justin1-150x150.png 150w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Justin1-300x297.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px""></a></p>
<p>With just a month to train, he bought some Newtons, <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-boco-at-ii"">(the Boco AT’s to be exact)</a> did a Newton running clinic at the local running store, and started running. He managed to pull off a 3:50. He’s been running and racing (in Newtons) ever since.</p>
<p>Now, Cogley logs 50 miles a week, he started doing triathlons and longer distance running races, he’s lost 27 pounds, and he’s inspired several servers at the restaurant to take up running, too. He’s even started making breakfast (homemade granola, vanilla yogurt, and apricots) for the Treadmill’s twice-a-month running group.</p>
<p>Most recently, Cogley placed 39 out of 509 participants in the North Face Endurance Challenge 50K in San Francisco. The former professional figure skater, who spent four years touring the world with Disney On Ice before trading his skates for his chef’s hat, says, “It’s silly that I didn’t fall into another sport earlier than this year.”</p>
<p>Cogley, who travels a lot for work, says running has not only been a great way to see other cities around the world, it has helped him deal with nerves and stress, and it’s lead him to cut out his late-night after-work snacking—a common pitfall for a chef’s waistline.</p>

<p>Although his lifestyle hasn’t always been the healthiest, he says, for the most part his work has always been about lighter fare and pure flavors. “It’s about trying to find the purist flavors in every product.” He looks for ultra-seasonal ingredients to make things like local vegetable-based sauces and simple seafood dishes. He even uses teas, such as chamomile as a stock.</p>
<p>Some of his favorite dishes? Salmon slowly cooked in a tea-based stock. “Its super healthy, no oils. It’s not seared or baked, so it doesn’t get over-baked. It just stays in that liquid on top of the stove for about 15 minutes.” For breakfast, he goes for Amaranth porridge with apple and chopped chestnuts. “Amaranth is way healthier than quinoa.” And, here, he shared this delicious salad recipe (below), noting, “We use a lot of vinaigrettes made with juices, not oils.” Of course, he says, there’s always room for a little dark chocolate.</p>

				<p>Exercising depletes your resources and fuel stores from your muscles. Eating within an hour of completing your workout will help to increase your recovery time and set you up for success on your next workout . Below is one of our favorite post workout recipes from <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> athlete and Chef Justin Cogley. If you’re short on time, consider grabbing a Lärabar or something that will refuel you on the go!</p>
<p><strong>Steamed Rice</strong></p>
<p>1 cups long-grain white rice<br>
1 1/2 cups water<br>
1 teaspoon kosher salt (optional)<br>
Total Time: About 30 mins<br>
Makes: About 3 cups</p>
<p>Method<br>
Place rice and measured water in a medium saucepan with a tight fitting lid and bring to a boil over high heat. Add salt (if using), stir to incorporate, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer undisturbed until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit covered to steam, about 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve. Check Seasoning</p>
<p><strong>Raw Kale Salad</strong></p>
<p>1/4 cup dried cherries, chopped<br>
1 cup small diced green apple, (about 1 apple) squeeze some lemon juice on it after you dice it<br>
1 pound fresh Tuscan kale, washed, rinsed, and patted dry (any type of Kale would work)<br>
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br>
3 Tbsp olive oil<br>
1 Tbsp seasoned rice vinegar<br>
1 Tbsp honey Or agave syrup<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
1/2 cup fried pumpkin seeds</p>
<p>Method<br>
Use a sharp knife to cut out the tough midrib of each kale leaf, and discard or compost. Slice the leaves crosswise into thin slices. The easiest way to do this is to work with a small bunch of leaves at a time, stack the leaves and roll them into a loose cigar shape. Then using a sharp knife, work from one end of the “cigar” to the other, slicing as thin as you can. Place the kale slices into a large bowl.</p>
<p>In a smaller bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, olive oil, rice vinegar, honey or agave salt, and pepper. A hour before serving, toss the kale together with the dried cherries, green apple and the dressing, allowing the kale to marinate a bit. Right before serving, Top with the fried mustard seeds</p>
<p><strong>Roast Pork Shoulder</strong></p>
<p>1(3-4 lb) pork shoulder butt, roast<br>
2 Cups apple juice<br>
2 Tablespoons Fennel seed, Toasted and Ground<br>
1 Tablespoon Coriander seed, Toasted and ground<br>
1 Tablespoon Smoked Paprika<br>
1 Teaspoon brown sugar<br>
2 Tablespoon salt<br>
Fresh Ground Pepper (to taste)</p>
<p>Using hands press the brown sugar and spices well into the meat on all sides making certain to adhear the spice mixture to the meat. Place the roast in a casserole dish with a lid. Add the apple juice.<br>
Cover tightly.<br>
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Add the roast for 15 min. and then immediately reduce the temperature down to 200 degrees F. Roast for about 4 hours or until the meat is falling-apart tender (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the roast). Slice meat as desired. CHECK SEASONING.</p>
<p>Now put the dish together. Put around half a cup of rice,(depends how hungry you are) top with a portion of the pork, finally adding the kale salad on top. Top with more fried pumpkin seeds. Enjoy after a long run.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Bar1.png""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5209"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Bar1.png"" alt=""Bar"" width=""500"" height=""500"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Bar1.png 960w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Bar1-150x150.png 150w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Bar1-300x300.png 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Bar1-624x624.png 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px""></a></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>Makes about 20 Bars</p>
<p>4 Cups Oats<br>
1/2 Cup Sliced almonds (no skin)<br>
1/4 Cup Sunflower seeds<br>
1/4 Cup Flax Seed<br>
1 Cup Diced Dried apricot<br>
1/2 Cup Dried Cherry or Cranberry</p>
<p>1/2 Cup grape seed oil or coconut oil<br>
1/2 Cup Peanut Butter<br>
1/2 Cup Brown sugar<br>
1/2 Cup Maple syrup<br>
1 tsp. vanilla<br>
pinch of salt</p>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Pre heat oven to 350. degrees. Bake in a 9 1/2 by 12 by 1 inch pan. ( or something similar) The bars should be about 1 inch thick. (the 1 inch is my preference for a thicker chewy bar)</p>
<p>Mix the dry ingredients together. Heat all the wet ingredients over medium low heat until the sugar is combined. Next, pour the wet ingredients over the dry and mix until combined.</p>
<p>Once the mixture is all combined put into the baking pan. Put the pan into the oven for 7 minutes at 350 degrees. At 7 minutes pull out the pan from the oven and press the bar down all around with a spatula. This will help it stay together later. Then return to the oven for 8 more minutes. After a total baking time of 15 minutes pull out and let cool for 20 minutes. Finally cut into bars. They will last for around 5 days at room temperature. Take on your next running adventure</p>

				<p>Thinking about taking on a full or 70.3 Ironman Race, but don’t know how to train? We’ve compiled expert advice from <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a> professional athletes to let you in on their training tips.

Training shouldn’t feel like a chore, so get the most out of your training and have fun!</p>
<p><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Running Off The Bike – Tim Van Berkel; Professional Triathlete</strong></p>
<p>No matter which way you slice it or dice it, running off the bike is tough! Whether you’re an age-grouper or an elite athlete, you’re going to face some challenges when you make the transition from riding to running. As you’ll discover, there are actually some physiological and mental issues that make running after riding difficult. The good news is there are some very practical things you can do to minimize your discomfort, as well as the inevitable drop in efficiency that comes at the start of the run leg. So… let’s get into it!</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s tough to run off the bike</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the ‘man ‘flu’, the issue of finding it difficult to run off the bike is real and well-documented. A recent French study found that 70% of elite triathletes ran up to 10% slower in the first 500-1000m of the run leg. Another study showed that transition-phase running is marked by greater oxygen consumption and higher breathing and heart rates. There’s no question about it – running economy is measurably lower after riding – that’s why it feels tougher. Less clear are the causes of this issue. Let me quickly go through some of the suggested explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theory #1 -After hard cycling for anywhere between 40-180km, some experts argue that your legs are glycogen-depleted – hence the feeling of heaviness and unresponsiveness. Some also argue that it could be dehydration taking its toll as well. Both of these theories make sense, but they don’t explain why the issue usually sorts itself out after the first couple of kilometers.</li>
<li>Theory #2 – When you begin the run your nervous system is still in ‘riding mode’. It takes a while for your brain to adjust to a whole new neuro-muscular coordination pattern. The fact is, everyone feels ‘un-co’ when they get off the bike and start running!</li>
<li>Theory #3 – Different movement patterns engage different muscles in different ways, which requires a redistribution of blood from one set of muscles to another. Riding is a simpler activity as far as muscle activation goes – it primarily involves your quads and hamstrings. While these two muscles are obviously heavily used on the run leg, the overall muscular ‘equation’ is much more complicated. Running requires the coordination of a much larger number of muscles – add in your glutes, hip flexors, abductors and core and upper body as well. That’s not surprising. Riding has a two-stage action, whereas running involves a more complex four-stage action. The short version is – it takes a little while for the blood flow to adjust – getting sufficient oxygen to the muscles that need it and dealing with the lactic acid build-up in the now less-active muscles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to maximize your off the bike performance</strong></p>
<p>So, if the problem is real – the question, as always, is how do we overcome it? Here are my top seven tips for dealing with ‘off the bike syndrome’:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice, practice, practice! Whether you decide to do a ‘brick’ – a full bike session followed by a full run session – or a shorter ‘transition run’ – a full bike session followed by a short run (10-20 mins), in either case you’re conditioning your muscles and your nervous system to cope better with the bike-run transition. Research shows that elite athletes adapt more rapidly that age-group athletes when they run off the bike. My guess is that’s simply because we practice that transition more often and so our bodies get better at adjusting to the change. Whatever your level of ability, practicing the transition will make a huge difference.</li>
<li>Lighten the gears slightly as you get towards the end of the bike leg. Give your legs a chance to recover before you have to run – you can save a little energy and gain some ‘fresh legs’ without making major sacrifices of time.</li>
<li>While we’re talking bike legs – the bike leg should be your very own ‘rolling buffet’. One way to minimize the dangers of glycogen depletion and dehydration is to make sure you eat and drink sufficiently on the bike. Have a clear plan and know how many grams and mils you need to consume to set yourself up for the run.</li>
<li>Don’t go out too hard at the start of the run leg. When I get out of T2 my one aim is to ‘find my rhythm’. My focus is inward – I want to find that ‘sweet spot’ where my running feels fluid and strong. I’m not thinking about chasing, I just want to find my groove. That leads me to my next point…</li>
<li>Concentrate on your running style. If you watch runners come out of T2 closely, you’ll notice that many of them are running with a more stooped, body-forward posture. That could be caused by fatigue or from the bike to run adjustment. Either way, it’s not an efficient running posture. Concentrate on staying upright, engaging the glutes, relaxing the upper body and stretching your legs out.<br>
Think ‘relaxed and floating’ rather than ‘Hunchback of Notre Dame’.</li>
<li>Run with a watch such as a Garmin (including Heart Rate Monitor) so that you can get a realistic idea of pacing – based on hard data, not on ‘feel’. As my coach, Dr Dan says, “The numbers don’t lie”. You can use the data collected for later analysis too.</li>
<li>Practice your T2 transition. This is one place where valuable time can be made or lost and it’s one advantage you can give yourself that has nothing to do with fitness – it’s about technique and practice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Running off the bike can be tough, but the good thing is – it’s tough for everyone. That means that if you can get a handle on the issue and work at minimizing its impact using the tips we’ve discussed, you will have a definite edge over your competitors. That first couple of kilometers out of T2 can set you up for the rest of the race and time shaved there can have a huge impact on your final result. That’s not a bad tip to finish with – if you can take a difficulty and turn it into an opportunity, then you’re one big step closer to success. And that’s not just true for triathlon, that’s true for life!</p>

<p><strong>Tempo Runs<br>
By:  Craig “Crowie” Alexander; Professional Triathlete</strong></p>
<p>A lot of athletes fear the run in a 70.3 or Ironman race and train to just get through it.  Training at tempo can greatly impact both speed and endurance on race day by helping the body make mitochondrial adaptations to be more efficient at any pace.  The goal for any distance runner should be the ability to burn fat as a fuel at the fastest pace possible.  In most physiological research, this is simply called the cross over point which usually falls just sub-lactate threshold for most athletes.  Knowing your cross over point and training to get your pace faster at cross over will help increase efficiency even at slower paces as you will be able to do more work using stored calories on the body vs. fighting a losing battle to replace lost carbohydrates.</p>
<p>There are two ways to bump up your cross over point via training.  The first is to run you slow runs slow.  Long runs should be done at an easy, aerobic pace to develop fat burning capacity.  The trick with these long slow distance runs is to not fuel with carbohydrates prior to the run and not take any in until after 1 hour and 30 min into the run as this will stimulate fat burning.  The other way to get a faster pace at cross over is to do tempo running.  Good, steady tempo runs are the “money runs” for any triathlete and should be something in the plan on a weekly basis.  These runs should be completed at a pace that is around your stand alone 1/2 marathon pace or just slower than 10km pace.  A few, sample sustained tempo runs are listed below.  Enjoy becoming more efficient by burning more fat as fuel at a faster pace.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Tempo runs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>20/ 10 Tempo:</strong></p>
<p>15min warm-up jog</p>
<p>20min at tempo pace (10km + 5-10sec per mile)</p>
<p>5min jog</p>
<p>10min at tempo pace</p>
<p>10min cool-down jog</p>
<p><strong>Swing Paced Run:</strong></p>
<p>10min warm up</p>
<p>3 sets of:</p>
<p>3min at marathon race pace</p>
<p>3min at 1/2 marathon race pace</p>
<p>2 min at a steady jog</p>
<p>8min at tempo pace</p>

</strong><br>
You’ve put in the hard work and mileage for your next race and are excited for your upcoming<br>
race adventure. A lot of times you have improved your nutritional choices, either consciously or<br>
subconsciously, throughout your training and preparation. But as race week and travel<br>
approaches, this is one of the most often overlooked factors to your success on race day. For<br>
me, I’ve got several food allergies/sensitivities along with being Celiac, so I have to be super<br>
careful with food choices while on the road. I’ve found that the biggest factor in determining<br>
your ‘success’ is planning ahead! Here are my top tips while traveling.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Keep your diet as close to what is ‘normal’ for you in the week leading up to the race.<br>
Hopefully this is a balanced diet full of LOTS of healthy fats, low-to-moderate carbs, and<br>
sufficient protein, coming from whole/real food choices with minimal (if any) processed<br>
foods.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Either book accommodations on websites like VRBO or Airbnb that offer kitchens or hotels<br>
that have a fridge/microwave or kitchenette. If you are a ‘foodie’ and want to explore local<br>
food options, save ‘experimental’ foods until after the race by sticking with tried and true<br>
options in the days leading up to the race.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Travel with a few items that can help with food prep. My suitcase generally has more<br>
kitchen items in it than clothes! Here’s what I pack: Ninja Express Chopper/Blender, Mini-<br>
Rice Cooker (can be used not only for rice/quinoa but also for eggs, steaming veggies,<br>
‘grilling’ chicken or other proteins, and more), Palm Peeler, Measuring Spoons, Knife and<br>
cutting board, travel can opener, ziplock bags and steamer bags (awesome in a pinch when<br>
your only option is the microwave), and camping bowl, plate, and silverware as they are<br>
lightweight and collapsable to take up minimal suitcase space. I also usually throw in a few<br>
spices in small jewelry sized bags.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Race Day Food. Whatever you are planning to eat for breakfast and during the race…be<br>
sure it is in your suitcase, as there is no guarantee your destination will have exactly what<br>
you want.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Comfort Foods. For me this is my favorite chocolates. For Randy…coffee!</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Travel Food. The biggest obstacle here is getting your food through TSA security without<br>
anything getting confiscated. I have an awesome Food Bag by PackIt that is freezable and<br>
TSA approved. I fill this up with travel day snacks and any other ‘must-haves’ for the trip<br>
that require refrigeration. I’ve also got a set of camping silverware that is more durable than<br>
plastic silverware and is allowed through security too. If you have something that is liquid,<br>
semi-solid, or gel/paste-like there are a few way to ensure it passes the security scrutiny.<br>
Carry it in individual serving packets (ex: nut butters, chia/flax seeds); use several travel<br>
containers that are 3.4oz or smaller, or you can freeze so it’ll be solid going through the<br>
scanner and will thaw out along the way (coconut water; butter (yep, I always travel with<br>
butter!); coconut oil). Its always a good idea to throw in a few empty ziplock freezer bags<br>
that you can fill will ice once through security.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> If driving in a car, pack a cooler. Most of the time we go into auto-pilot and try to reach are<br>
destination as fast as possible (you just have to beat the GPS arrival time, right?!)…but<br>
taking a few extra minutes to drive an extra mile or two off the exit, can give you much better<br>
options than gas stations and fast food. Grocery stores and mini-marts come in quite handy.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Hydration. Take an empty water bottle and/or Tumbler. Fill up with water before getting on<br>
the plane. You can even take tea bags and make some hot tea on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> A few suggestions for travel food: Nuts/Seeds; Nut/Seed Butters; Avocados, Hard Boiled<br>
Eggs, Fresh/Frozen Fruit, Veggies and Hummus, Whole Food and/or Fruit Bars, Baby Food<br>
Pouches, Lunchmeat, Pre-Made Salad/Wrap, and Leftovers.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Post-race: Celebrate and Treat Yourself to something special and savor the local flavors!</p>
<p>Happy Running!</p>

				<p>Newton Ambassador and Chef, Justin Cogley shares with us a halibut recipe that has a sauce that reminds him of walking around Thailand. He describes this dish as, “super simple, just like some of the street food in Thailand.”</p>
<p><strong>Halibut, Roasted with Hazelnuts, Bok Choy, Cilantro and Ginger.</strong></p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<p><strong><u>Ingredients</u></strong></p>
<p>3/4 cup finely chopped toasted hazelnuts</p>
<p>1/2 cup panko (Dried Breadcrumbs)</p>
<p>1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley (sliced)</p>
<p>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives</p>
<p>4 6-ounce halibut fillets (each about 1 inch thick)</p>
<p>6 tablespoons butter, melted</p>
<p>Lemon wedges</p>
<p><strong><u>Preparation</u></strong></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400°F.</p>
<p>Mix hazelnuts, breadcrumbs, and herbs in small bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Brush each fish fillet with 1 tablespoon melted butter; season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Place fish on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle breadcrumb-herb mixture atop fish, dividing equally and pressing to adhere. Roast fish until just opaque in center, about 8 minutes. If crisper topping desired, preheat broiler and broil fish about 1 minute, watching carefully to prevent burning. Season with lemon juice.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cilantro-ginger sauce</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Ingredients</u></strong></p>
<p>1/2 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves (save the stems, see below*)</p>
<p>1/2 cup packed fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves</p>
<p>2 shallots (diced)</p>
<p>1 large garlic clove</p>
<p>2 teaspoons grated peeled fresh gingerroot</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</p>
<p>2 tablespoons soy sauce</p>
<p>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</p>
<p><strong><u>Preparation</u></strong></p>
<p>Have ready a bowl of ice water. In a small saucepan of boiling water blanch cilantro and parsley 10 seconds and drain in a sieve. Refresh herbs in ice water and drain in sieve. Chop shallots and garlic.</p>
<p>In a small nonstick skillet cook shallots, garlic, ginger root, and cumin, in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until shallots are softened. In a blender purée shallot mixture, herbs, and about a  1/4 cup water, and soy sauce until smooth, about 1 minute, and season with salt and pepper. Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.</p>
<p><strong><u>Bok Choy</u></strong></p>
<p>4 heads of baby bok choy (separated into individual leaves)</p>
<p>Salt</p>
<p>lemon juice</p>
<p><strong><u>Preparation</u></strong></p>
<p>Have ready a bowl of ice water. In a small saucepan of boiling salted water blanch the bok choy leaves for 45 seconds. If plating right away season the bok choy with lemon juice and salt.</p>
<p><strong><u>Plating</u></strong></p>
<p>Add about 2 tablespoons of sauce to the middle of each of 4 plates. Place the fish onto the sauce and add the leaves of bok choy around the side of the fish.</p>
<p>* The cilantro stems have tons of flavor. I like to slice them up, add a touch of olive oil, salt and some lime or lemon juice and make a simple vinaigrette. You can spoon this around the fish before serving also.</p>
<p>* This recipe is also great with roasted cauliflower, salmon, or pork.</p>

<div class=""post-info"">
<div class=""post-meta"">Maybe you’re inspired to run to raise awareness for a cause that’s close to your heart, or perhaps it’s all about the personal challenge. Whatever your motivation for running a marathon is, one thing is certain— it’s a monumental, life-changing experience.</div>
</div>
<div class=""wysiwyg"">
<p>Training for a marathon is intense, taking place over the course of months or even years. From building base mileage to speed work, you will constantly be challenging and pushing your body to its limits.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that many runners training for a marathon implement yoga into their cross training regimens. Yoga aids runners by increasing blood flow to overworked joints and muscles, promoting healing and making the most out of rest days. Yoga also stretches and strengthens the muscles of the legs, core and spine. Perhaps most surprisingly, yoga is a workout for the mind and helps instill a sense of determination that will definitely be crucial come race day.</p>
<p>Here are a few of our favorite yoga poses for runners. Try focusing on these postures next time you’re in a yoga class, and feel free to ask your instructor for pointers to nail them. Good luck snagging a PR at your next race!</p>

				<p>It was the summer of 1988. Triathlete, John Maclean was out on a training ride when he was struck by an eight ton truck going 70 mph, and his whole life changed. John suffered multiple breaks to his pelvis and back, a fractured sternum, punctured lungs, a broken arm, and at age 22, John was now a paraplegic. “I was in a world of pain.”</p>
<p>Rather than accepting a life filled with excruciating pain, a wheelchair and assistance, John decided to become bigger, stronger and more independent than ever. He set out on a life goal to never be defined by his wheelchair, but to adapt to life in a wheelchair by pushing #Extraordinary boundaries in the sport of triathlon.</p>
<p>Since setting out on his #Extraordinary journey, John’s list of accomplishments has exponentially grown. In 1994, John became the first Australian wheelchair triathlete to complete a race. Soon after, he became the first wheelchair athlete to complete all “able-bodied” cut off times at Hawaii Ironman!</p>
<p>Despite the life changing event Maclean endured, he has lived and continues to live a life with a fiery passion of achieving the same goals he had 28 years ago. In 2013, John took his first steps out of his wheelchair and realized that the impossible really was possible. “from the nervous-system activity I can see, I believe you should be able to walk” were the words from his physical therapist that kept him going. After hours of mental and physical heartache, physical therapy and patience, that is exactly what John did, he walked on the beach with his wife, so much more than he could’ve ever imagined was possible, 28 years ago.</p>
<p>“And then I did things I’d dreamed about all those years: to walk on the beach with my wife holding hands, to pick up my son from day care…these are gold medal moments in life.”</p>
<p>In his latest and greatest accomplishment John completed the same triathlon that he did in 1994 as a wheelchair triathlete, as a conventional athlete, meaning he completed the run portion of the race on his own two feet, rather than in a wheelchair!</p>

<p>Throughout his journey, John created the John Maclean Foundation to provide financial assistance to children in wheelchairs. JMF provides financial assistance to purchase items such as new wheelchairs, vehicle and house modifications, surgery and medical assistance, computers, remedial aids or any item that improves the quality of life for the child and their family.</p>

<p>Newton Running is proud to be a sponsor of the inaugural 106° West Triathlon, the highest triathlon in the world. 106 West is set for September 10, 2016 in Dillon, CO.</p>
<p>We met up with the founder of Human Movement Management Inc., Jeff Suffolk, to learn about how he came up with the idea of 106°West Triathlon, why Newton Running’s presence amplifies the event, and his plans for the highest tri in the world!</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Tell us a little bit about Human Movement Inc.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: We are a 6 year old company that wants to create proprietary, unique events that can’t be recreated anywhere else in the world. We are enthusiasts about active entertainment and are constantly trying to find ways to get people up and moving and have fun doing it. We’ve done everything from PBR Ribbon Pond hockey, Denver’s Oktoberfest Stein holding contest, the first Ugly Sweater Run and much, much more. We just bought a 500 acre ranch in Bailey, CO to start hosting additional proprietary events. Stay tuned for a calendar of events.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How did you come up with the idea of 106° West Triathlon?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: “We wanted to come up with the most proprietary, distinct event and location that no one else would be able to duplicate, and immediately Lake Dillion came to mind. I had first heard about the lake 10 years ago when I was working with the IronKids series in Colorado, and found it puzzling that even though the lake allowed boats, paddle boarders and fisherman, swimming was not allowed.</p>
<p>Once the idea of 106° came to mind, I reached out to some of the local board members in Dillon to see what I needed to do in order to break down the barriers of not being able to swim in the lake… I was told it was going to be a long time until I got an answer. The reason why? Lake Dillon is actually Denver’s Water Source. Dillon Dam Road is federally protected because it services 100% of Denver’s water.</p>
<p>After staying in contact for about 7 years and reminding the community leaders of my vision to hold a triathlon in Lake Dillon, I was contacted by the board members in Dillon letting me know they were ready to have a meeting to vote on allowing 106°West to happen in the lake…and it was approved!</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why Dillon, CO?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: “When it comes to these types of experiences, (the highest open water swim, a challenging yet beautiful bike ride, highest tri in the world) I want people to drop the expectations and ENJOY the experience!  The town of Dillon will allow spectators and athletes to do just that. Dillon is truly a magical town surrounded by mountains and in the heart of ski country. The scenery the athletes will take in during the entirety of the race will be something they’ll remember.”</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What do the swim; bike and running course look like?</p>
<ol>
<li>Swimming: The race will start at the marina and go across Lake Dillon.</li>
<li>Biking: Athletes will head east to the city of Montezuma, a quirky, cool town. From a starting point of 9,071ft elevation, it’s a continuous climb to Montezuma. There is no doubt this will be a challenging and memorable bike course.</li>
<li>Running: The run will start at the Dillon Marina and weave its way along the Dillon Reservoir. The total elevation gain will be 706 ft.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why Newton Running as a sponsor?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: We are a CO company and this is going to be a true CO native event. We wouldn’t want to partner with anyone other than another CO brand. Plus, Newton Running got its start with triathlons and continues to offer triathletes and runners all over the world high-performing running products.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> You have a 10 year agreement with the Town of Dillon to utilize the lake. How do you see the race evolving over this timespan?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: “Like the original mission of Human Movement, we want this event to be unique and legendary. We think this will become a bucket list event in some regards, and people from all over the world will come and try it. You won’t set a PR at this race, but now and 10 years from now this event will be unlike any other race an athlete will ever do.”</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What are you anticipating to be the biggest challenge for participants?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: “In addition to the elevation, course and stunning scenery, unpredictable weather in September could be a challenge. We’ve got a first rate operations and logistics team to ensure every aspect of the race runs smoothly and offers athletes the best possible experience.”</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why should people sign up?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: “Why shouldn’t they is the question! I think the reason you get into triathlons is to test your physical and mental limits. Seasoned triathletes reach a point where they’re just testing themselves against time, and I believe this race will test the athletes against the reason why they got into triathlons in the first place.”<br>

				<p>When it comes to running, Melody Fairchild knows what she likes and doesn’t like. For instance, uphills “yes,” downhills “no,” Newtons “yes,” other brands “no.” She should know, she has been running since she was 14. And we’re not talking jogging. She was the first high school girl to break 10 minutes for 2 miles and from there her list of accolades is long.</p>
<p>Last summer she turned 40 and aged up to Masters. She quickly proved she would be a force to be reckoned with in this category with three wins last fall in the space of a month: first place at the USA Masters 5K Championships with a time of 16:51; first place at the 15K Masters National Championship; and 1<sup>st</sup> female, and 2<sup>nd</sup> overall at the Project Athena US Trail Half Marathon, which served as the half marathon national championships, in Moab, Utah.</p>
<p>Fairchild started 2014 with a goal to do all of the USATF Masters National Championships and a main goal of doing the Master’s National Championship in the marathon at the Medtronic Twin City Marathon in Minneapolis in October. Obviously, age has not diminished ability nor competitive spirit.</p>
<p>So far this year, Fairchild has taken 2<sup>nd</sup> in the half marathon in Melbourne, Florida and 2<sup>nd</sup> at the USA Cross Country Championships in Boulder, both in February. Results most runners would consider great. But, Fairchild doesn’t like to lose. “In the Twin Cities, I plan on being a contender to win and I would like to win. I will have my work cut out for me, there are a lot of really good Master’s marathoners out there, including the two women who I have been beaten by already this year.”</p>

<p>Although Fairchild makes running look easy, she has had her share of bumps in the road. Looking back on her career, she credits her ability to still run strong to the fact that she took a break from running from about the time she was 27 to 37. This was at a time when many of her running colleagues were pushing the envelope and taking their careers to another level professionally performance wise. Her body was telling her to do otherwise. “I had to really listen to my body, and it was telling me to stop running. I had massive sciatic nerve pain and my feet were hurting. Rather than getting surgery on my feet to keep running, I went an alternative healing route.” Fairchild focused on getting healthy.</p>
<p>Along the path to healing, Fairchild also found a friend in Newtons. “I’ve been told I have a dropped metatarsal head. I thought it was a neuroma.” No matter how you cut it, it’s painful. “I also have large bunyans, which is why Newtons are great for my feet, because they have a nice wide toebox. With other shoes, I would have to cut them open because there was too much pressure on my feet.”</p>
<p>Fairchild used to race in the <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/womens-distance-elite-16"">Distance Elite</a> and train in the Distance U, which she loves because it’s so light. But then, last summer, she discovered the new Energy—not a shoe you would immediately pair with an elite athlete. “ I ran a half marathon in Costa Rica last summer and placed 2nd. Normally, I would take a racing flat, but I ran the whole race in my Energies.”</p>
<p>Fairchild says, for any Newton lovers with any sort of forefoot issue the Energy is just a fabulous option. ”I still feel the energy return that you get from a Newton, but it’s just so much more gentle on the forefoot, especially if you have a neuroma or a bone bruise.”</p>
<p><b>            </b>Listening to and looking after your body, especially as a runner, is a message Fairchild now loves to share with the next generation of athletes. When she’s not training and racing—or planning for her wedding this summer (it’s true!)—she’s busy coaching across Boulder County. She runs after school cross-country and track programs, and running camps for girls in the summer. “My girls running camp in the summer is a passion of mine.  I know the pitfalls that befall young women. I help my girls gain a perspective of themselves and their life. It is a long winding road.”</p>
<p>As she runs from job to job and race to race, Fairchild knows that winding road well. But at this stage in life, she’s loving every minute of it. “It’s so awesome to be paid to run. Every day I get up and train and look forward to the next race I have planned. I definitely don’t take it for granted.” She adds, “For someone my age, competing at the level I am, to have the support from a shoe company, is off the charts.”</p>

				<p><span style=""line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;""> </span>“Run fast. Pray hard.” That’s Danielle Duhon’s running motto. It’s what got her to the Boston marathon in 2011 and what is taking her there again this year. “Boston is like the average runner’s Olympics,” she says.  “Running Boston in 2011 was one of the greatest running experiences I’ll ever have. The crowd support and the privilege of having qualified and getting to run that course, is something I’ll never take for granted.” She adds, “It was such a blessing and an honor to be there, even if I never qualified again.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/danielle-chairdivision2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4785"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/danielle-chairdivision2-614x1024.jpg"" alt=""danielle-chairdivision2"" width=""430"" height=""717"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/danielle-chairdivision2-614x1024.jpg 614w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/danielle-chairdivision2-180x300.jpg 180w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/danielle-chairdivision2-624x1039.jpg 624w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/danielle-chairdivision2.jpg 1176w"" sizes=""(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px""></a></p>
<p>            The 43-year-old has qualified for Boston every year since, but traveling for a race can be expensive. Not to mention she works the night shift as a nurse and has three young daughters, the oldest of whom is disabled. But this year, is different. “I didn’t go back in 2012 or 2013. The reason I’m going back this year is because of the events of last year. I decided it was important for me to go back and show my support for the city after the events of last year.”</p>
<p>Aside from running alongside the more than 35,660 participants who also are running Boston this year, she’s headed to the race with her sister and seven of her girlfriends. All of who qualified. “It’s amazing we all qualified and got in. I think it will be really special and an honor to run for the people who can’t run this year. For those who lost their lives and to say ‘thank you’ to the city.”</p>
<p>But Duhon hopes this won’t be her last time running Boston. She has another goal in mind for which she will rely on her motto again, as well as the words of triathlete, Jessie Thomas, “Your best performance can come in spite of your biggest doubts. Always give your self a chance to succeed.” Duhon would like to run Boston again pushing her 14-year-old daughter in her new running chair. “My oldest daughter is handicapped and we just raised money to buy her a pushchair. My goal is to qualify for the push chair division. I am small and she weighs more than me, so it will likely take me more than a year to get there. I think she would be ecstatic. She just waves like she is in a pageant when I push her in races. It will be a tough road, but my goal is to give her that experience, however long it takes me to get there.”</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Danielle-Chairdivision.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4784"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Danielle-Chairdivision-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Danielle-Chairdivision"" width=""625"" height=""468"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Danielle-Chairdivision-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Danielle-Chairdivision-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Danielle-Chairdivision-624x468.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a></p>
<p>As she looks toward her next goal, and even her ensuing race, Duhon credits Newton for her ability to still run at all. When she first began to marathon train, she would get injured every time she increased her mileage—stress fractures, IT band issues, Achilles tendinitis—you name it, she had it. In March of 2009, she ran her first marathon in New Orleans in a time of 4:07. “I was injured again afterward and went in search of a new shoe.” That’s then she was fitted in the <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/womens-distance-v-b"">Newton Distance</a>. That summer, she began to increase her mileage and remained injury free. In December 2009, she ran her second marathon in a time of 3:41, giving her the qualifying time for Boston. “Nine months later and 26 minutes off my time. What? The only thing I changed were my shoes.”</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and she’s gone through about 12 pairs of the Distance U and is headed to Boston for the second time. For the next few days, she’ll tuck away her thoughts on running it a third time with her daughter and try to just savor the moment—a change from the first time she ran Boston. “Last time I ran Boston, I wanted to run my fastest time and I didn’t enjoy the race as much as I would have liked, because I was looking at my watch and trying to PR. I missed my PR by 3 seconds and I came home disappointed.” She adds, “This time I promised myself I wouldn’t run for the time, but would enjoy myself more and soak up every single moment of this race. Especially with everything that happened there last year, we owe it to that crowd to enjoy every single second.” Then, she’ll get back to running fast and praying hard to make her next goal happen.</p>

				<h1><span style=""line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"">Don’t be fooled by the quiet reserve of Newton elite team member Fernando Cabada—he’s ready to race.</span></h1>
<p>Stealth is one way you could describe elite Newton athlete Fernando Cabada. He is silent (when he’s not ribbing his teammates) and potentially deadly when running. Determined is another apt description. As is the comeback kid. But, no matter how you describe him, he is fast. And, he’s hoping his speed will place him in a top 3 position in the U.S. Olympic Trials for marathon in February, 2016.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-IAAF.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4792"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-IAAF.jpg"" alt=""Fernando IAAF"" width=""504"" height=""672"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-IAAF.jpg 720w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-IAAF-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-IAAF-624x832.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px""></a></p>
<p>            Far fetched? No. Not given that he placed 7<sup>th</sup> with a time of 2:11.53 at the last Olympic Trials, which took place in Houston, Texas in January, 2012. On that same track, he recently ran a personal best half marathon time of 1:02:00. This was good enough for him to make the USA team for the World Half Marathon Championships, which took place in Copenhagen, Denmark in March. The US team placed 7<sup>th</sup> overall.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-Team-USA.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4795"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-Team-USA.jpg"" alt=""Fernando Team USA"" width=""960"" height=""605"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-Team-USA.jpg 960w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-Team-USA-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Fernando-Team-USA-624x393.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px""></a></p>
<p>These accolades come on top of a longer list, including the fact that he set the American 25-K record with a time of 1:14:21, and he has been a three-time US Champion.</p>
<p>But there is another motivator that is driving him to the trials in Los Angeles in 2016. Cabada grew up in Fresno, California. This is the place where he learned determination and where running, in a sense, saved his life. Nothing would be more satisfying than having a top 3 finish in front of the home crowd—nothing, except for wearing “USA” across his chest at the Olympics.</p>
<p>Fernando Cabada grew up in Fresno with a single mom and a dad who went in and out of prison. When he was in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade, his mom was awarded assistance from the Housing Choice Voucher Program Section 8, which meant that Fernando and his mom could move to a safe neighborhood that also had a better school. Cabada suddenly had access to physical education and sports.</p>

<p>“I was in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade and I went out and ran a half mile. I was second in my class. I was kind of fast. In 4<sup>th</sup> grade, I could go out for cross-country. My dad was pretty hard on me with sports, so I steered away from baseball and basketball. Running was the thing I could choose myself.”</p>
<p>Running helped him to fit into a very affluent neighborhood and school system—think the Orange County of Fresno, where everyone drives a BMW.  Cabada’s mom was on welfare, which meant he had free lunch tickets. Rather than stand out by using the tickets, Cabada chose not to eat. He went for years without eating much at school. “I wouldn’t eat. I wouldn’t start eating until I was in my Junior year, when my uncle would give me a job on the weekends. Then, I had $5 a day to buy something at lunch. People could see money in my hand. I didn’t want to stand out so much.</p>
<p>“I was embarrassed, I didn’t have the style of clothes everyone had. I was defensive and reserved. I wasn’t like them, so if anything I was more segregated than ever until I was in high school on the cross-country team.”</p>
<p>At the nationally distinguished Buchanan High School, Cabada began to dream about running with the senior team. “I would daydream for hours of running with the varsity team, so people would say, ‘Who is that brown kid?’ But these were just dreams, I didn’t believe it would happen. It’s like saying you’re going to win a lottery.”</p>
<p>In his Junior year, Cabada won the lottery so to speak, when he became nationally ranked and number 1 on the team. In his senior year, he was Athlete of the Year, beating out all of the football players and other athletes at the school.  After graduating in 2000, he attended college, something no one in his family had done before. Next, he jumped into the pro running circuit. But without a team of college friends to run with, running suddenly wasn’t quite so enjoyable.</p>
<p>“In college, in senior year, you’re going to these races to try to make as much noise as you can to continue your dream and you’ll do anything to get it. But you forget, you have to keep working. It’s hard to get it, but it’s hard to keep it.” After hitting some of his best times ever, he incurred some injuries and a sponsorship deal he had with another company ended in 2010. Cabada hit a slump. He considered hanging up his running shoes and headed to the oil fields of North Dakota to try to make ends meet. But once he got there, he realized, “I can’t quit running, I’m too good.” And he is.</p>
<p>Newton took notice of Cabada in 2012 after his seventh place finish at the marathon Olympic Trials in Houston. A relationship was forged and now surrounded by a team once again, Cabada’s enthusiasm has increased as his times have dropped. Now, with Boulder, CO established as his home, the once reserved runner is finally comfortable in his own skin and is even known for his sense of humor and being vocal on the team. Although he admits, “I’m pretty honest and sometimes can be controversial.”</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1978835_10152321373894054_4363178398961231075_n.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4796"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1978835_10152321373894054_4363178398961231075_n.jpg"" alt=""1978835_10152321373894054_4363178398961231075_n"" width=""960"" height=""641"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1978835_10152321373894054_4363178398961231075_n.jpg 960w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1978835_10152321373894054_4363178398961231075_n-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1978835_10152321373894054_4363178398961231075_n-624x416.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px""></a></p>
<p>But that edge is what has helped drive his running. He is the Newton Running elite team’s fastest member. His plan is to get faster over the course of the next 21 months. “I had to have an edge walking to elementary school, because you were going through a neighborhood where you might get into a fight. This has helped me in my racing and life itself. If a situation is going bad, I can always put things in perspective.” He adds, “For me in my world, I’ve already won in life. I didn’t follow in my father’s footsteps. Now it’s all bonus.” And hopefully, that bonus will payout on February 13, 2016.</p>

				<h1><b>A World Record for Dad and the 1 in 6 Men Diagnosed with Prostate Cancer Each Year</b></h1>
<p>Where did the time go? It seems like I was just 10 years old sitting on the couch flipping through the Guinness Book of World Records. Now 15, I just got the email stating, “Winter, your world record for the youngest person to run a marathon on all 7 continents has officially been recorded into the record books.”  It seemed like such a simple task back then. Run seven marathons around the world. Running was by far the easiest part of realizing this dream, though. The journey? Well that is another story.</p>
<p>At age 13, I ran my first marathon just 50 minutes from my home in Salem, Oregon, and at this marathon, “the great” Meb Keflezighi was there to give me encouragement and some last minute strategy. After all the controversy to get me into my first marathon, I felt I had a lot to prove that day. I still remember hearing my coach’s voice echo in my head as I hit mile 23, “Winter, you can run that course in 3:45:00”. <a href=""http://www.mprunning.com/about.html"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mprunning.com/about.html', 'Coach Hadley');"">Coach Hadley</a> not only was right but more importantly he believed in me. Just five minutes shy of a Boston qualifying time, this 13 year-old conquered Eugene Marathon in 3:45:04. A precedent had been set. I was serious about my mission and my running.</p>

<p>My next marathon added many elements on top of the pure fact of running 26.2 miles. There was travel, heat, pre-race nutrition issues and much more to consider.</p>
<p>You would think getting into a marathon in Africa would be easy for a 14 year-old, after all, it’s common for kids to walk more than ten miles round trip to school a day. I was shocked when I started getting turned down in South Africa by race directors.  By pure coincidence, I was introduced to The Amazing Maasai race directors who just happened to be two young women with running backgrounds. They had previously been on the Amazing Race TV Show, which is what inspired them to start this marathon to aid in the education of Kenyan girls. Thank goodness they believed in me! After taking 3<sup>rd</sup> place overall female in 4:04, through tough terrain and heat, my love for trail marathons began. I found the tougher the course; the stronger I performed. Much of my race was captured on film by a Canadian TV Show called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZpoWH1R9sQ"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZpoWH1R9sQ', 'Boundless');"">Boundless</a>.</p>

<p>There is nothing like going from the extreme heat of the Maasai plains in Kenya to one of the harshest, coldest places in the world, Antarctica. First you fly to “El Fin Del Mundo,” The End of the World, also known as Ushuaia, Argentina. Waiting for us there was a Russian research vessel to take us across Drakes Pass, know for some of the roughest seas in the World.</p>
<p>Several day’s later, blustery weather prevented us from going on shore. Instead, we found ourselves on land, for the first time in days, just minutes before the start of the marathon. No one really talked about what “getting your sea legs,” meant, but several miles into the marathon I realized the ground appeared to be rolling like waves under my feet. By not having spent any time off the ship prior to running on land, I had not gotten rid of my “sea legs.”</p>
<p>But without a single fall (the ice was another challenge), I finished in 4:49:45—another 3<sup>rd</sup> place finish. I was now the youngest person in the world to run 26.2 miles in Antarctica.</p>

<p>Next, I headed to the Inca Trail, which I documented <b><a title=""Inca Trail Marathon"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/uncategorized/never-give-in-running-the-inca-trail-marathon/"" target=""_blank"">here</a></b><b> </b>in an earlier blog. At this, my fourth marathon, I captured my first overall female marathon win. If you are a runner and up for a challenge and adventure of a lifetime, the Inca Trail Marathon should definitely be on your bucket list.</p>

<p>My fifth marathon was across the diverse terrain of a small island called the Great Barrier Island, off the coast of New Zealand. Running the first half of the marathon through the interior mountain trails and then finishing the last half on the paved coastline was an interesting mix to say the least. Even at my young age, it was definitely a transition my legs and feet felt, going from the soft surface of trails to the pounding of pavement. It definitely gave me a reminder of why I had fallen in love with trail running.</p>

<p>The second toughest marathon I traveled to was definitely Mongolia’s Sunrise to Sunset Marathon, which I also documented <b><a title=""Sunrise to Sunset Marathon"" href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/uncategorized/mongolia-sunrise-to-sunset/"" target=""_blank"">in an earlier blog</a></b>. Despite the remoteness of this marathon, the incredibly athletic and talented crew from Boundless was able to capture amazing footage for their TV Show. The crew ran alongside us through the dark forest, down the steep ravines, all the while carrying heavy cameras and microphones. I was truly in awe as I caught glimpses of the TV crew at random places on the course.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about history from the places I traveled over my 18-month journey. Completing my marathon tour in Athens, Greece, on the original course of Phidipiddies, was a fitting place to set a marathon world record. A place where women where originally shunned and even killed for watching the Olympics. Where only “winners” were called athletes, others were just mere participants. It was my first full road marathon since Eugene and I cherished every footstep across the 26.2 miles. The spectators that lined the course all shouted “Bravo” as we ran by. In Greece, runners are still considered highly respectable athletes and are praised. Crossing the finish line in the Panathenaic Stadium, home of the first modern Olympics, was an unforgettable moment. I pointed to the sky, symbolically to my dad, as I always do at the finish line, and thought to myself, “Dad, we did it!”</p>
<h3><b>Back to Snow</b></h3>
<p>Immediately upon returning from Greece, I exchanged my running shoes for ski boots. I had only a few days to reflect on my five-year journey to setting this world record. I think it will take me years to really comprehend what I was able to accomplish. My aerial skiing has now taken precedence in my life as I pursue a spot at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Several weeks ago I concluded my 2014 aerial season with a Jr. National title and 5th Place podium at the Jr. World Freestyle Championships in Italy. Some great steps toward my next big dream have been taken.</p>

<h3><b>Will there be an Ultra?</b></h3>
<p>Many are asking what is next with my running. I definitely plan to tackle my first ultra marathon in the near future. As of today, my Newton running shoes are back on as I train for two big events in June 2014. I have been asked to join the winning team from last year’s <a href=""https://www.roparun.nl/english/what-is-roparun/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.roparun.nl/english/what-is-roparun/', 'Ropa Run');"">Ropa Run</a> in Europe. This is a well-known relay running event in Europe that raises money for cancer. I will join a team of seven men, with a total support crew of 26 people. We will run a 330-mile relay from Hamburg, Germany to Rotterdam, Netherlands. I will run roughly 80, one-kilometer sprints over a 30-hour period.</p>
<p>Then, I will join Simon Donato and a crew of elite runners and searchers to explore the high Sierras of California in search of a missing, downed military plane. We will hike up to 15 miles a day in harsh terrain at elevations of 10,000 to 12,000 feet, camping in tents and supported only by supplies brought in on horseback. Follow me on this great adventure with Adventure Science!</p>
<h3><b>Obstacle Course Racing &amp; More</b></h3>
<p>I’m currently planning the rest of my summer events. Aside from my aerials training, you will definitely see me challenging my Newton’s on the Spartan Race courses, including the Spartan World Championships—and why not throw in a few triathlons as well!</p>
<p>Never Give In!</p>

				<p>Let’s face it life is busy. We get it. From the time you wake up to the time you go to bed, you’re moving in a hundred different directions (or at least it feels like it) between work, family, friends, and, getting that daily workout in. But on top of all of those daily activities, we sometimes neglect to refuel our bodies with the right nutrients to keep us going. So here’s an easy solution: a quick-and-easy breakfast that you can take anywhere (at anytime…we won’t hold you to breakfast). It can even be prepped over the weekend for the week ahead. Give it a whirl…and then let us know what you think!</p>

				<h2>Stephen Pifer’s running genes might just be the key to his consistent success, year over year</h2>
<p>Stephen Pifer has running in his genes and it shows. He has been a natural from the moment he stepped onto the track in 1997 at age 13 and broke an 18-year-old school record with a 5:07 in the 1600 meters. Although his math teacher was quick to point out to him that the 1600 meters is not a mile (technically it’s 1609 meters), he’s been breaking records ever since. He has competed twice in the Olympic Track and Field trials for 1500 meters and most recently, the soon-to-be 30-year-old qualified for the U.S. Olympic Trials for marathon in February, 2016 with a time of 63.44 in the half marathon. He’s also been consistent. He’s run a sub-4 minute mile for 9 years, and hopes to make a decade of running sub-4s later this year.</p>
<p>You don’t have to look far to see where Pifer’s running genes came from. His grandfather started the running program at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. His uncle was an All American at the same university and still holds the school record for the 800 meters. He went on to run marathons and eventually became Pifer’s high school coach before moving to Colorado to continue coaching. Both Pifer’s parents ran track in high school, too.</p>
<p>But before Pifer could commit to follow in the family footsteps, he had some things to do. He played soccer and basketball. In his freshman year of high school he made the Junior Varsity basketball team and basketball was his passion. But in this same year, his uncle recorded the Footlocker HS Cross Country Nationals.  Pifer watched the race and decided he wanted to go to this meet. His basketball coach was none too happy, when Pifer told him mid Freshman season that he was quitting to focus on running.</p>
<p>By the time his senior year rolled around, Pifer was a five-time school record holder and a two-time All-American in the Distance Medley Relay and the mile. That year, he became only the 6th man in Illinois’s history to win the Cross Country, 1600-meter and 3200-meter State Titles in the same year. And yes, he finally made it to the Footlocker HS Cross Country Nationals where he placed 14<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>This was good enough to land him a scholarship to CU Boulder where despite a rookie mistake that sidelined him for most of his freshman year, he garnered strong results. “Freshman year things went up and down. I got hurt running on the Mesa Trail. It was a Rookie mistake, trying to be a showoff. I watched my teammates go to the Nationals for cross-country.” But things picked up from there.<a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1458474_651862388197823_623068786_n.jpg""><br>
</a></p>
<p>Pifer became an All-Conference finisher (Big 12) four times and an All-Regional finisher three times in cross-country. He made Nationals and was an individual All-American four times. Although his team won two national titles, winning the Big 12 Conference in 2008 as a team was the highlight of his time at CU. “Not to take away from the NCAA championships, but winning the Big 12 title as a team was the best. We had a good group. It was a real team effort.” He credits the coaches for fostering this team spirit from the get go. “As Freshmen, we had a dodgeball team to try to tie everyone together. We were the ‘Track Whackers’. We had long jumpers and shot putters, we all knew each other and that synergy we developed led us to win over these powerhouse schools.” It was on the CU track team that Pifer met his future wife, Laura Zeigle “a stud runner in her own right,” he says.</p>
<p>From CU, Pifer headed to Portland in 2009, to run for one of the larger shoe companies. Where some runners struggle outside of college, Pifer still felt he was part of a team and as a result he had one of his best years yet, including a 4<sup>th </sup>-place finish in the 1500 meters at the USA National Championships. It was during this time, he and his wife started a family. “I was in a position where I didn’t have to work another job. I could train and hang out with my family and then go train again. It was pretty awesome.”</p>
<p>It was also during this time that his uncle, who was still coaching in Colorado, showed him a pair of Newton shoes. “I thought they looked crazy.” He appreciated being up on the ball of his feet, but he wasn’t sure about this new shoe company. But then a college friend went to work for Newton and a few years later as Pifer’s contract drew to a close, he says, “I noticed Newton was still around. I figured they’re obviously doing something right.” The next thing he knew he had landed a job with the company as a tech rep in Florida.</p>
<p>Having become used to getting free shoes in college, he said, “I had to look it as though it wasn’t me buying the shoe, because I go through a pair once every 6-8 weeks.” But now when he considers durability and dollars per mile spent, he says, “I get way more miles out of my Newtons than I did for any other shoe I’ve ever worn.”</p>

<p>Having recently relocated to Colorado for Newton. Pifer was psyched to be chosen to run on one of the Bolder Boulder elite teams with his fellow Newton teammates Tyler McCandless and Fernando Cabada. Now, as he looks toward the ensuing Olympic marathon trials, he says, “Consistency is definitely something to be proud of. People get injured if you’re overdoing things. I am not getting faster, but I’m not getting slower. Hopefully, I can PR, I’m not ruling that out.”</p>
<p>As for his boys, between his wife and him, one can only assume the running genes found their way to them as well. But Pifer will let them find their own way to running, just as he did. “If they want to do it, I think they’ll have the talent,” says Pifer. For now, he says, they’re doing jumps on their scooters, rock climbing and hiking, and taking advantage of everything Boulder has to offer. Pifer adds, “We’re just having fun.”</p>

				<h1>The Truth About Newton Running</h1>
<p>Like a carefree first-grader effortlessly bounding across the playground, Newton Running celebrated its 7<sup>th</sup> birthday in late March at the IRONMAN triathlon in Oceanside, California. My co-founder Jerry Lee and I began living a dream the day we started <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com"">Newton Running</a>. A dream founded with a revolutionary idea, a small assortment of demo shoes and a resolve to change not only the world of running, but through giving back, perhaps even change the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0080.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4904"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0080-1024x678.jpg"" alt=""DSC_0080"" width=""438"" height=""289"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0080-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0080-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0080-624x413.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px""></a></p>
<p>As I reflect on the past seven years, and Newton’s growing place in the running market, I have never been more proud of the direction of our company or inspired by the uplifting daily reminders of the positive impact we’ve had on runners around the globe. Perhaps most gratifying is Newton’s unwavering commitment to a consistent set of innovative beliefs that have guided the company from its earliest days and led so many runners to find a home with the Newton tribe.</p>
<p>At Newton, we believe in:</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Helping You Run Better:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 14px;"">There’s a “Right” way to run. This doesn’t mean all runners run alike or that you must run a certain way to enjoy running or the unique benefits of Newton running shoes.

<li>Every runner can run better. Did you know that running form drills are a standard part of the training regimens for most of the elite athletes who work with Newton?

				<h1>When a health crisis hit his family, Newton Ambassador Thad Beaty, began to move his musical life toward new ways that mattered.</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Thad Beaty loves music. Always has. When the guitar player for the country band Sugarland, is not on the road, he’s in Nashville working at his day job, Sorted Noise, producing songs for movies. But in 2009, a curveball was thrown at him, when his mom was diagnosed with colon cancer. Since then, his daily routine has involved a lot more than music.</p>
<p>At the time of the diagnosis, the 5’10” Beatty was 34 years old and weighed 230 pounds. He says, “We went into panic mode. My brother, my wife and I and my mom all decided as a family that we could do better at being healthy. So, we immediately started researching the best diet for dealing with cancer,” he says. What happened next, was something he never would have expected.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Thad-Beaty.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4917"" alt=""Thad Beaty, guitarist for country Grammy band Sugarland"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Thad-Beaty.jpg"" width=""700"" height=""467"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Thad-Beaty.jpg 700w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Thad-Beaty-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Thad-Beaty-624x416.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px""></a></p>
<p>“We learned that a raw diet, greatly lowers your cancer risk levels. But we thought, ‘good grief, there’s no way we can do that.’” Yet, he and his wife bought a Vitamix blender and started having smoothies for breakfast and salads for lunch. And suddenly, they were 66 percent raw already.</p>
<p>“Before I knew it, I was fully vegetarian a few months out and the only thing left before I went Vegan was Greek yogurt—that was the last stronghold.”</p>
<p>At the same time that his food transformation was taking place, Beaty started exercising.  While on the road with the band, he started to run. “I could take off running in the middle of nowhere.” When he came home there was a pool in his neighborhood, so he started swimming. Next, he pulled out his old mountain bike. “I was doing a little of each and a little more and then something just triggered along the way.”</p>
<p>Before he knew it, Beaty was Vegan, and his training turned to competing in triathlons—not just sprint triathlons, but Ironman triathlons, with his first in Arizona in 2012, then Kona in 2013. His 230 pounds quickly melted away to a stealth 160 pounds. In a relatively short period of time, his very Southern family had completely transformed itself, including his mom, who is now gluten free and vegan.</p>
<p>Along the way, Beaty started reading Newton co-founder, Danny Abshire’s book, <i>Natural Running: The Simple Path to Stronger, Healthier Running. </i>“I started working on all the drills. Then I bought Newtons and hit the road. I was amazed at how my body felt and my times were way faster. I was hooked.”</p>
<p>As Beaty started down the Ironman path, he started to consider the powerful correlation between sport, the music industry and giving back. First, he struck up a relationship with the Ironman organization. Then, he began to look for companies who shared his belief system of giving back.  A training partner and Newton athlete, Shay Eskew, shared with him the non-profit work that Newton was doing. “Once I realized our core values aligned well, I had to reach out.” A partnership was struck, and now he says, “We have done some amazing things together and I think we will do a ton more.”</p>
<p>Around this time, Beaty founded Musicthatmoves.org to encourage the music industry to give back in ways that are healthy for the community. His motivation was spurred by the fact that in addition to his mom’s illness, the band’s guitar tech, Kevin Quigley, was diagnosed with Lymphoma and lost his battle against the disease less than a year later.</p>
<p>“Health is holistic. It is mind, body and spirit. If you don’t have a good balance of those three, then you are out of whack. I saw how harmonious endurance events and getting involved in social movements were together.”</p>
<p>Now, Beaty and a team of about 20 people from the music industry are training for the Ragnar Relay from Chattanooga to Nashville in October to “reclaim their health”.  Of his teammates, Beaty says, “They didn’t all come from an athletic background and they want to make a change. So we’re going on this journey together.” Each member is doing the relay to raise money for a cause or non-profit of their choice. “What resonated so strongly with them is that endurance events become a beautiful vehicle to affect change. If you do it for a cause, it becomes super special.”</p>
<p>Beaty and fellow Newton Runner, Bo Parrish, have also teamed up to form <b>New Life for Newton,</b> connecting gently used Newton shoes with cross-country and track coaches and inner city kids who are in need of shoes. They have enjoyed delivering the shoes themselves to these young running teams and spending an afternoon or day training with them. The list of initiatives Beaty has taken on is long and this is in addition to work and still training hard. Ironman Chattanooga in September is on his hit list for this year. But now with several races under his belt, he says, “It’s not about the finish line, it’s about everything you learn getting to the finish line and then that’s a place to celebrate everything you’ve learned and to carry those lessons forward.” For now, he’s celebrating the fact that his mom’s cancer is in remission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #003366;"">You can watch Thad Beaty on ABC this Tuesday, July 15, on “Extreme Makeover Weight Loss.” In the episode he worked with a woman who went from the couch to doing a 70.3 triathlon. Beaty says, “We had her rocking some Newtons.”</span></p>

				<p><span style=""line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"">Brenda Guajardo is not your typical runner. But then again, most people who thrive in races that average 100 miles on the road, are not your every day runner. The Texas native, who has a 100-mile PR of 16:33, has had top finishes at the <a href=""http://www.spartathlon.gr/en/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.spartathlon.gr/en/', 'Spartathlon Ultra Race');"">Spartathlon Ultra Race</a> (153 miles) in Greece and California’s <a href=""http://www.badwater.com/"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.badwater.com/', 'Badwater Ultramarathon');"">Badwater Ultramarathon</a> (135 miles). She’s been first overall female at North Carolina’s Graveyard 100-mile and Florida’s Keys 100 Ultramarathon, amongst other top finishes. And yet, the 38-year-old Guajardo didn’t compete, or even run, in high school or college. Instead, she was an aerobics instructor who found her workout wasn’t cutting it anymore, so she started to run.</span></p>
<h1><b><span style=""color: #000000;"">WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST RACE?</span> </b></h1>
<p>First, I did the Austin marathon in 1996. I was 19. It took me 6 hours. I came in third from last. In 1997, I did the same race in 4.5 hours. From there, I kept running and I never stopped.</p>
<h1><b><span style=""color: #000000;"">WHEN DID YOU CHANGE FROM MARATHONS TO ULTRAS?</span> </b></h1>
<p>When I moved to Virginia in 2000, I needed a way to meet people. The big thing there was triathlons. I was like I can run and I have swum before and surely I can ride a bike. I did a couple of sprint triathlons. I always needed to finish so I could get to the finish line party.</p>
<p>In 2004, I signed up for an Ironman in North Carolina, even though it wasn’t trademarked that. My family flew in to see me do this race. The race day came and I missed the bike cut-off by over an hour maybe two hours. I got to the transition area and they said you’re disqualified. I said, my family has flown here, can I give you my timing chip and finish the run and they said ‘yes.’ It still took me 5 hours. But I caught enough people to not finish dead last in the whole race.</p>
<p>The next day I was embarrassed. I was supposed to be an Ironman and none of that happened. I went to REI and found this documentary called <i>Running On the Sun</i> about Badwater Ultramarathon. People were throwing up, crying and passing out. One guy had his toenails surgically removed, and I’m looking at this thinking this is what I’m meant to do. I will suffer but it looks like a lot of fun. This is the bucket list race.</p>
<h1><span style=""color: #000000;""><b>THE ROAD TO BADWATER</b></span></h1>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartathlon-2013.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4941"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spartathlon-2013.jpg"" alt=""Spartathlon 2013"" width=""598"" height=""1008""></a></p>
<p>In 2011, I got invited. You have to be invited and only 90 people get invited. To do Badwater, you have to had completed at least three 100-mile races within a calendar year and you have to submit a running resume. It’s not enough to have just finished three ultras. You have to have done well.</p>
<p>Preparing for and running Badwater, that just set the whole ultra scene for me. I fell in love with the adrenaline rush of getting ready for the races and pushing the limit physically and mentally. That will always be my dream race. The traditional Badwater is unique to any other race on the planet because of the climate, the temperatures and the solitude of not seeing anything for miles and miles.</p>
<h1><b><span style=""color: #000000;"">WHAT’S YOUR AVERAGE WEEKLY MILEAGE?</span> </b></h1>

<p>I run up to 130 miles the week before races and do about 5-6 weeks of 100-plus miles. For the Spartathlon last September—a 153-mile race—I got up to 150 miles a week in training.</p>
<h1><b><span style=""color: #000000;"">WHY NEWTON?</span> </b></h1>

<p>My coach is a huge proponent of Newton. She kept telling me about these shoes. Finally, leading up to my second 100-miler, I tried them and then I went and ran 20 miles. It was the most wonderful run I have ever had. I realized this is the fit that I need and I have never used another brand since. I stopped having injuries. My form got better. I attended the Newton coach training school so I could learn more about the science and the drills behind the product. It’s not just a shoe, there’s an actual science behind the shoe. That’s what is unique about Newton and that’s what I fell in love with, the science.</p>
<p>Going into 2012, I had my fourth 100-mile race. I was the first female and I won in 16 hours and 33 minutes. I went from running a 19:50 to a 16:33. I wholeheartedly believe it was because of what I learned from Newton and my coach. It’s those two variables that made a difference.</p>
<p>I decided to write Newton to be on the pro team. But every year the pro field was closed. Then the guy in charge of the pros said why don’t you contact Stephen Gartside who runs the elite team. Up until late 2012 the elite team had been closed to only people living in Boulder, Colorado [home of Newton headquarters]. 2013 is the first time Newton has let people outside of Boulder join the team. So Gartside and I ran together a few times, then in January 2014, he said “Welcome to the team!”</p>

<p>Before I switched to Newton’s exclusively, yes, I had injuries. I tore my soleus, I had a partial tear in my hamstring, and there were good chunks of time where the nerve endings in my metatarsal were inflamed so I had to water run because I couldn’t run on land. Between my Newtons and my coach making sure I don’t over train, I have had no injuries or blisters. One pair of shoes no blisters.</p>
<p>At Spartathlon in Greece, they plop you down in a wheelchair when you finish and take you to the medical tent to tend to your feet. They took pictures of my feet because there was nothing wrong with them. That’s the way it should be.</p>

<p>When I’m running I drink juice, Gatorade, shakes. I do no solid foods at all regardless of the distance. Occasionally, I might ask for 2 or 3 Pringle chips. But when I say that, I legitimately mean 3 chips, if you hand me 10, I will eat 3 and put the rest on the ground.</p>
<p>When the race is over the best food I have ever had was in Italy. No other place to eat on the planet than in Italy. To stuff my face with prosciutto, wine, and pasta, that is just the closest thing to heaven that could possibly be on this planet for me.</p>
<h1><b><span style=""color: #000000;"">WHY THE ROAD?</span> </b></h1>
<p>I really just enjoy the open road. It puts me in a good place mentally when I’m out there by myself. There are days that I start crying when I’m out there because I ‘m just in love with that moment of the road and me, it’s an intense love affair with the road.</p>
<h1><b><span style=""color: #000000;"">WHAT DO PEOPLE AT WORK THINK?</span> </b></h1>
<p>My coworkers generally think I’m crazy. My desk becomes a confession stand where people feel compelled to confess that they haven’t worked out or that they ate unhealthy. They know what I’ve done and it’s like they’re seeking forgiveness for not having done their workout when they know what I’m doing.</p>
<h1><b><span style=""color: #000000;"">FAVORITE MUSIC TO RUN TO:</span> </b></h1>
<p>I like to listen to music. I have everything from Julio Iglesias in Spanish to classical piano to Eminem to Annie Lennox. I have the full spectrum and I just genuinely love music. Me and a pair of Newtons with my ipod is about the equivalent of someone handing me a winning lottery ticket.</p>

<p>I just finished my biggest goal for the year. It was a double ultra, two weekends back to back. I did the Nove Colli 125-mile race in Italy in the mountains. And then, 5 days later there was a 100K road race in Italy. I found out later that I’m the only female who has done the double. They keep records for how fast all the guys have gone and the times I ran it places me in 4<sup>th</sup> place overall ever.</p>
<p>I haven’t chosen a race for fall yet. I am looking for a PR. I would like to break 16 hours.</p>

				<h1>With the Olympic Marathon Trials and finishing his Ph.D both on the horizon, Tyler McCandless talks to us about balancing work, running and his drive to give back to the people of Kauai.</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>As the 2014 Kauai Marathon and Half Marathon approaches (it takes place August 31), we caught up with Newton runner, Tyler McCandless, who has won the Kauai Marathon three years in a row. This year, he’ll run the Half Marathon, while also focusing on the Kauai Marathon Kids Foundation.</p>
<p>Catching up with the 27-year-old McCandless in any context (not just running) is not necessarily easy. The former Penn State All-American runner, turned pro, qualified for the Olympic marathon trials at the Twin Cities marathon last October. But in addition to his training, he also is currently working on his Ph.D. through a collaborative research program run between Penn State and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. He holds a BS and Masters degree in Meteorology from Penn State.</p>
<div id=""attachment_4978"" style=""max-width: 635px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/tyler4.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-4978"" alt=""tyler4"" src=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/tyler4-1024x768.jpg"" width=""625"" height=""468"" srcset=""https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/tyler4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/tyler4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.newtonrunning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/tyler4-624x468.jpg 624w"" sizes=""(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px""></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Tyler running his way to a first place finish at the Newton Race For The Cure in Eldorado Springs.</p></div>
<p> </p>
<p>But being busy is what McCandless prefers. He tried taking a break from school and just focusing on running for a time, but he says, “I actually didn’t improve much in those two years. It took me going back to school to start improving again.” Now, working, running with a new coach (Steve Jones) and giving back to the people of Hawaii, McCandless has found his best balance yet.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #464646;""><b>Newton: You took time off from academics to run, but then decided to go back to school. Why was that? </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #464646;""><b>McCandless:</b></span> “I think everyone needs a balance. For some people, the balance is single focus that’s all they do—think about running and what they eat and how they sleep, it’s all encompassing. For me, I tried that and I did the best I could and it ended up being more stressful and taking the fun out of it. With my academics it took the stress off and now the running is the funnest part of my day. It makes me someone who enjoys the sport for the purity of it.”</p>
<p><b>Newton: You’ve noted your new coach, Steve Jones, has also helped you to enjoy running more as of late. </b></p>
<p><b>McCAndless:</b> I officially started the Ph.D. program January 1, 2013. But it’s kind of like 3 things happened at once. I restarted my Ph.D. program and then a few months later I got Steve Jones as a coach and 2 months later I signed on with Newton. It was a great combination: Newton made me feel like I was competing as part of a team and a family again; I had a new coach who believed in me and that I could do great things; and, I was part of a Ph.D program that set my focus not just on running and made me more well balanced.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #464646;""><b>Newton: You have a special place in your heart for the Kauai Marathon and the work you’re doing there. Can you tell us about this? </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #464646;""><b>McCandless:</b></span> I have won the Kauai marathon three years in a row. Every time I leave the island, I come back a better person. It’s a beautiful place and people are friendly, it makes me feel very empowered to give back to the people who have been good to me.</p>
<p>This year, I am doing the Kauai Half Marathon to raise money for the Kauai Marathon Youth Running Program. It’s a year-round running program and mentorship between the high school and elementary school. The kids run together, tally their miles, and really get a sense of accomplishment. I set a goal for running the half marathon in an hour and 5 minutes, to raise $13,100 for the program.</p>
<p>The overall goal is to put on a 5K in the spring as a build up to the Kauai Marathon in the summer. With the 5K, we also want to put on a health and wellness expo to teach kids about nutrition and science and full-body wellness. I have been working with Healthy Learning Paths. They work to empower kids to live healthier lives through in-school curriculum and after school activities. One of the top diseases is obesity, and with running, we can be really powerful and make a difference in our communities.</p>
<p>Newton is donating 50 pairs of shoes to kids participating ing the program. This is what I love about running for Newton. The socially responsible aspect of the company is something I take pride in. It’s more than a shoe company. They put shoes on your feet and you wear their name, but it’s more like you’re competing for a family that is trying to do good in the world and make it a better place which makes running even more fun and gives you a bigger purpose.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #464646;""><b>Newton: After Kauai, what’s next? </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #464646;""><b>McCandless:</b></span> I’ll do some Grand Prix races. I’ll go back to Twin Cities this fall. It’s the US Championships and my goal is to try to win. Last year, I had the same goal and I faded over the last 10K or so. I want to establish myself as a contender for the Olympic trials. But even if I make an Olympic team and I look back on what I’ve done in my career, what I’ve done in Kauai is just as powerful to me—that I was able to make an impact in a powerful way.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #464646;""><b>Newton: In closing, can you share with us your favorite running-related moment? </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #464646;""><b>McCandless: </b></span>When I was in Kauai for the second time, the night before the race, I was going to make banana pancakes and I had run out of bananas. I went to this farmer’s market, and I was browsing and some kid starts yelling, “Tyler.” Then, he says, “Thanks for coming to our team and speaking to us about running,” and he handed me bananas. They are expensive. What are the odds that he knew I was looking for bananas? I was blown away by the generosity—I was speechless.<b></b></p>
<p>I’m trying to keep a more balanced approach to running, where you’re running the absolute best you can but having the most fun and making the biggest positive impact.</p>

				<p>Enter here for your chance to win a trip to the <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/run-wine-napa""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"">Napa to Sonoma Wine Country Half Marathon in 2016</span></a>:</p>
<p><strong>Below is a true story, as told by Newton’s VP of eCommerce David Dunn:</strong> I’ve spent the past year raving about an exceptionally unique half-marathon with an aid station that serves Guinness. Because I am a serious beer enthusiast, those closest to me always ask “…you drank some right?” And my answer, begrudgingly, “…no….but next time definitely.” The past two years I’ve been fortunate enough to support Newton’s presence at the Napa to Sonoma Wine Country Half Marathon. It’s a tough job. The original and most popular race in the amazing half-marathon race series presented by Destination Races, The Napa to Sonoma Wine Country Half is truly a celebration of all we love about the sport of running. Now I’m not one of the Newton runners whose results show up in the weekly race report. I’m a 9:00 mile guy with a fullback frame that fits well with my penchant for beer. But I do love to run. And in 2014 I came to this race feeling fit. Fueled by my competitive side, I put my head down and pushed my way to the finish in a respectable time. But with the memory of that missed Guinness station lingering, I vowed to make 2015 a different experience. To slow the pace and find every opportunity to absorb all this spectacular race has to offer. At the start line, as the sun broke through the clouds, I meandered through stunning rows of grape vines lining the entrance to the Cuvaison Estate, and settled in between the 2:00 hr and 2:15 pace groups.</p>

An unabashed Bostonian quickly jumped in and grabbed the microphone.

It was the first of many wonderful moments that made this a day to remember and characterize the unique spirit of this race series. </span> <span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"">I ran the early miles with a runner from Texas who took the time to properly thank virtually every volunteer he passed on the course.</span> <span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;""> </span></p>

				<p>Newton’s resident Chef Justin Cogley (also the Chef at Aubergine in Carmel, California) has created the ultimate salad for Summer Runners:</p>
<p><strong>Serves 4 (or one person post long run)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong></p>
<p>6 ears of corn (shucked and cleaned)</p>
<p>2 cups of cherry tomatoes (mixed heirloom)</p>
<p>2 cups sugar snap (cleaned and cut in half)</p>
<p>4 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p>2 tbsp. vinegar (citron vinegar)</p>
<p>2 tbsp. chives (sliced)</p>
<p>2 tbsp. parsley (chopped)</p>
<p>2 teaspoons toasted and crushed cumin</p>
<p>Sea Salt and Pepper to taste.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Bring a large size pot of water to a boil, season with salt and blanch snap peas for 1 min. Shock in ice water. Drain and reserve.</p>
<p>Bring water back to a boil and blanch corn for 2min. Shock the Cobb in ice water, and when cool cut the kernels off and add to a mixing bowl. Add the blanched snap peas to the bowl.</p>
<p>Next. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half and add to the corn and snap pea bowl.</p>
<p>Now add the olive oil, vinegar, chives, parley, cumin, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.</p>
<p>This salad is best enjoyed the day of. The vinegar well start to brown the beans slightly if left overnight.</p>
<p>Tip: I use some really nice vinegars at Aubergine, because they can add such a great flavor. Vinagire de citron by Huilerie Beaujolaise is amazing and you can find it at specialty food shops.</p>

				<p>The leaves on the trees are changing, the temps are cooling, and the racing season is heating up! As many of you hit the home stretch of your training, here are a few final race day tips from fellow Newtonites to help ensure you are Race Day Ready.</p>
<h3><strong>Tim Van Berkel- Ironman Champion</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Next Big Race: </strong>Ironman Hawaii</p>
<p><strong>How He Is Preparing: </strong>A long slow distance run in the mountains, watch it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Ry8_nbHfk&amp;feature=youtu.be"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Ry8_nbHfk&amp;feature=youtu.be', 'here.');""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"">here.</span></a> To make it your own: pick an inspiring location and run by heart rate instead of pace. Tim keeps his heart rate in the 130 range, and takes in the scenery instead of mile splits on his two and a half hour long run.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Training Shoe:</strong> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-motion-v-b""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"">Motion </span></a><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-motion-v-b""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"">V.</span></a><em> </em> “It has great support for being so lightweight, plus I really like the neon green color.”</p>
<p><strong>F</strong><strong>avorite Racing Shoe: </strong><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-distance-v"">Distance V</a>. Tim’s three word description: light, responsive and supportive.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Fernando Cabada</strong>– 25k American Record Holder, 3 Time US Champion</h3>
<p><strong>Next Big Race: </strong>Chicago Marathon</p>
<p><strong>How He Is Preparing: </strong>Fernando’s favorite marathon workout is 6-8 x 1 mile with 2-3 minutes rest. Fernando runs 4:40-4:30 for each mile repeat. To make this workout your own: start your mile reps just faster than marathon pace and work your way down to half marathon pace.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Training Shoe:</strong> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-motion-mileage-trainer-iv"">Motion V</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-motion-mileage-trainer-iv"">V.</a><em>  </em>The Motion IV is light enough to accommodate fast training runs, but stable enough to withstand high-mileage training weeks</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Racing Shoe:</strong> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-distance-elite-16"">Distance Elite.</a> With a seamless, breathable mesh upper, and power packed sole, this is Fernando’s shoe of choice for a blazing fast marathon</p>
<h3><strong>Mike Andersen- 2014 Detroit Marathon Champion</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Next Big Race:</strong> 2015<strong> </strong>Detroit Marathon</p>
<p><strong>How He Is Preparing: </strong>Mike’s favorite marathon workout is 2 x 6 miles at marathon effort in a 20 mile run. He warms up 3 miles, does 6 miles at marathon pace, 2 mile jog, 6 miles at marathon pace, 3 mile jog. “I love the feeling of pushing through that second set hard and feeling the confidence from knowing the strength is there,” says Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Training Shoe:</strong> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-gravity-v-b"">Gravity V</a>. Mike loves the way the shoe performs over the long haul. “The Gravity is light enough to feel like a performance shoe but protective enough to get me through the 20 mile runs feeling healthy.”</p>
<p><strong>F</strong><strong>avorite Racing Shoe: </strong><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-distance-v"">Distance V.</a> “The shoe begs to go fast. As soon as I put it on I feel smooth, efficient, and ready to lay down some speed. The Distance was the original Newton I tried and fell in love with, it is the sports car ride on a natural platform.”</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Amanda Scott- US Olympic Marathon Trials Qualifier</h3>
<p><strong>Next Big Race: </strong>Chicago Marathon, watch her key workout for the marathon <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfjOoE2dqwM"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfjOoE2dqwM', 'here');"">here</a></p>
<p><strong>How She Is Preparing: </strong>Amanda races regularly in the build up to a key race. In the weeks leading up to Chicago, Amanda raced the Run for the Cure 4 Miler, RNR Virginia Beach and the Wisconsin 5k. How to make this strategy your own: choose a half marathon 6-7 weeks out from your marathon.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Training Shoe:</strong> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/women-gravity-v-b"">Gravity V</a>.<em>  </em>Amanda puts a lot of emphasis on staying healthy during the buildup to a marathon. The Gravity IV features full-foot technology (including the heel) which makes it both responsive and balanced.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Racing Shoe:</strong> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/womens-distance-elite-16""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"">Distance Elite.</span></a> “The lugs provide a little end-of-marathon power, when you need it the most.”</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Tyler McCandless- US Olympic Marathon Trials Qualifier</h3>
<p><strong>Next Big Race</strong>: Columbus 1/2 Marathon, and then onwards to the Olympic Trials. Watch Tyler doing some early morning training in Boulder <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfjOoE2dqwM"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfjOoE2dqwM', 'here');"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How He Is Preparing:</strong> Tyler’s favorite marathon specific workout is 3x3K off 3 min rest. “I know I’m very fit when I can be aggressive on the first one and still remain strong on the last rep.” How to make it your own: start with 3 x 1k, focusing on being consistent on each rep. The next week bump it up to 3 x 2k, and finally 3 x 3k in the third week.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Training Shoe:</strong> The <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-gravity-v-b"">Gravity V</a> for recovery runs, the <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-boco-sol-all-terrain-trainer-2015"">BOCO Sol </a>for trail runs, and the <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-distance-speed-trainer-iv-limited-edition"">Distance </a><a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/men-distance-speed-trainer-iv-limited-edition"">V</a> for workouts. Variety: the spice of life.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong><strong>avorite Racing Shoe:</strong> <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-distance-elite-16""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"">Distance Elite.</span></a> Tyler races often in hot and humid conditions (he is a mainstay in Kauai, Hawaii races) so he prefers the open mesh upper of the Distance Elite.

				<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Qualifying for the Olympic Trials is a huge accomplishment. Some athletes work their entire careers with this goal in mind. Once an athlete hears the news that he or she has qualified, they’re immediately flooded with emotions of excitement and nerves. Newton Running is proud to announce that we have four athletes from Newton Running Elite that qualified for the 2016 Olympic trials, so we wanted to ask them a few questions about their training and expectations for the race on February 13 in Los Angeles.</span></i></p>

<p><b><i>1. Describe some of your training as you’ve been preparing for the Olympic Trials.<br>
</i></b>For the main 10 weeks of my marathon build up I averaged over 100 miles per week. Some key workouts I have done was 12x1km at an average of 2:59 for each and for rest in between was a 200 meter jog done in under 90 seconds all done at 7700 feet elevation. I have gotten in three half marathons averaging right under 1:04. Biggest workout was a marathon 4 weeks before the Olympic Trials in 2:18:14 at Carlsbad Marathon.</p>

<p><b>Nashville, TN. Marathon PR – 2:32:37</b></p>
<p><b><i>1. Describe some of your training as you’ve been preparing for the Olympic Trials.<br>
</i></b>I ran the Rocket City Marathon in Huntsville, AL in early December as a long hard run and that felt good. Unfortunately my build up to the trials has been hampered by a nagging hamstring issue and I have not been able to get in the mileage or the speed work that I had hoped for.</p>
<p><b><i>2. Do you have a pre-race ritual that you make sure you do before every race?<br>
</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I don’t do this for every marathon but my two sisters were with me for my first marathon in 2004 and Jenny braided my hair.  Jenny and Julie will be with me again in LA so I will ask Jenny to braid it again before the race on Saturday. Aside from that I don’t have any real rituals or superstitions.</span></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.5;""><i>3. Is this your first time going to the Olympic Trials? If not, how many times have you been and what was it like?<br>
</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is my second time running at the Olympic Marathon Trials. In 2012 I was in much better shape but had to stop running shortly before the trials due to plantar fasciitis pain. Having rough buildups both in 2012 and this time around makes me realize just how hard it is to come into this race fit and 100% healthy. Regardless of that injury I had a great experience in 2012 and still ran a tiny PR (at the time). It is wonderful thing when the best marathoners in the country all come together to compete, even though only three make the team. I think it does a lot for our sport and the camaraderie among athletes</span></p>

<p><b>Boulder, CO. Marathon PR – 2:44.10<br>
</b><br>
<strong>1. Describe some of your training as you’ve been preparing for the Olympic Trials.</strong><br>
The training leading up to qualifying for the trials and as I prepare for the trials doesn’t deviate too much from what I normally do with my coach (Steve Jones) and my training group (Boulder Harriers). The biggest difference for me has been consistency. The problem I have is that I really like running and sometimes that gets me into trouble. I have a tendency to overdo it and not listen to my body when I feel a little niggle coming on. Sometimes that means that before I even realize it, I find myself with an injury. I’ve had two stress fractures over the past four years, one in my right foot and one in my left foot.  Luckily or at least hopefully, I’ve learned from those and I’ve been injury free since May.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Leading up to the race in Houston I put in a few more miles than I have in the past, but I added them in slowly. I had a few weeks around 100mi and during that time I made sure to get extra sleep, recovery, and nutrition. Unfortunately, my job requires a good deal of travel and often requires me to come into work before dawn. That leaves me having to do workouts on my own before the rest of my group’s training begins. Luckily, my coach is willing to come early and the two of us had a lot of quality sessions together. Our core sessions include 5min, 3min, 2min, and 90s reps, but we go all out on those. We also do hills and tempos on alternating weeks. I chose to do Houston Marathon because I knew with the holidays in December I would have a few weeks with no work travel. I think that made a difference being able to stay home, rest, and train without flying all over the country.</span></p>

</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I really try to focus on rest, nutrition, and visualization leading up to a race. Before the race in Houston, I wanted to find something to distract my mind and my time during the taper week. My friend gave me his 3,000 piece puzzle of the Maroon Bells. It’s quite an undertaking, but it kept me from trying to run and kept my mind off of worrying about the race. Before each marathon, I take a day off two days before the race and then the day before I do a 30-35min with about 6 pick-ups between 45-60s. This starts to shake out the taper and get my legs ready to roll. The morning of the race it’s the typical coffee, banana, peanut butter, and bagel plus I’ll look at a few inspirational quotes and jam out to some music. I was fortunate enough that I had some friends and training partners also racing Houston so we got to warm up together and encourage each other all weekend.</span></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.5;""><i>3. Is this your first time going to the Olympic Trials? If not, how many times have you been and what was it like?<br>
</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This will be my second time going to the Olympic Trials. I qualified for the 2012 Trials after running 2:45:26 at the 2011 Indianapolis Monumental Marathon. I had a great time racing in Houston for the 2012 Trials, but my foot started to hurt about half way through and that injury lasted a  few months. I finished the race but I didn’t ‘race’ the whole time. I used the last lap as a victory lap. This time I just want to go out there feeling fresh and have fun. I want to race smart and see who I can pick off towards the end of the race. For me, this is hopefully a stepping stone to running faster and smarter marathon in the future. I never thought I’d be running at the Olympic Trials or even still running after college, so all of this is still a dream come true and I’m excited to see where the dream goes next.</span></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.5;""><i>4. What are you thinking as you step up to the starting line?<br>
</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m thrilled to be going to the trials and excited to get the opportunity to stand on the starting line with the very best marathoners in America. I’m hoping to stay relaxed the first half and then see how many people I can pass the second half. I need to try and not get intimidated by the other runners and just be confident in my training and myself. I have to also realize that most people running in the trials don’t have to travel 30-40% of the time for work or work 50+ hr per week in addition to training. I have a good friend that lives in the LA area and she promised me that if I made it to the trials, we would go to Disneyland, so I’ll be thinking about going to Disney during the race as well!</span></p>

<h2>Tyler McCandless</h2>
<h4><b>Boulder, CO. Marathon PR – 2:15.26 </b></h4>
<p><strong>1. Describe some of your training as you’ve been preparing for the Olympic Trials.</strong><br>
I believe that consistency is more important than any specific workout or short term build-up.  In the 2015 calendar year, I ran an average of 92.5 miles per week and only had one unplanned day off due to illness. In the last nearly two months, I’ve averaged 105 miles per week with some of my fastest and toughest workouts.  I feel confident I am in the best shape of my life going into the 2016 USA Olympic Marathon trials.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you have a pre-race ritual that you make sure you do before every race?</strong><br>
Three hours before every race, I drink coffee, Red Ace Organics Beet Juice, and have oatmeal with peanut butter.  That’s about it for pre-race rituals; however, in order to keep my sanity and keep off my feet I usually read 1-2 books in the last few days or week leading into a peak marathon.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is this your first time going to the Olympic Trials? If not, how many times have you been and what was it like?</strong><br>
I competed at the 2012 Olympic Marathon Trials as a 25 year old.  I was so new out of college that I felt like a rookie.  I made the mistake of thinking that I needed to do so much to be prepared to race well and in doing so I over-trained and fatigue won that day.  This year I’ve incrementally increased my mileage and intensity, but I have not over-done it.  The biggest difference this year is that when I toe the line in Los Angeles; my parents, my girlfriend, and my girlfriend’s parents will all be there as well as many friends and family.  That support will go a long way in carrying me mentally and physically for 26.2 miles.</p>
<p><strong>4. What are you thinking as you step up to the starting line?</strong><br>
“First with the head, then with the heart, that’s how you win from the start.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>Fresh Shelling beans (you can sub dried, if fresh not available)</p>
<p>1 Avocado</p>
<p>Olive oil (or Blended, Grapeseed, sunflower)</p>
<p>Garlic</p>
<p>Salt and Pepper</p>
<p>Cherry Tomatoes</p>
<p>Eggs</p>
<p>Lemon</p>
<p>Chives</p>
<p>Parsley</p>
<p>Multi Grain bread or your favorite</p>
<p><strong><u>White runner bean puree- </u></strong> Fresh shelling bean season is going on now, these are great and will make a good amount. You will have extra for sandwiches or even a side with Halibut, Pork, or Steak</p>
<p>4 cups fresh runner beans (shucked)</p>
<p>2 cups oil (I use a canola – olive oil blend)</p>
<p>2 each garlic cloves</p>
<p>1/2 cup of the bean cooking liquid</p>
<p>Salt- To taste</p>
<p>Pepper- To taste</p>
<p>The Juice of Two lemons</p>
<p><strong><u>Method: </u></strong></p>
<p>In a small pot slowly heat garlic in oil over low heat. Basically the idea is to release a light garlic flavor into the oil. Heat for around 15 minutes, and take off the heat. Next add the runner beans to a large pot and cover with water (you can use chicken stock or vegetable stock for more flavor) Cook over medium heat for around 45 minutes or longer until tender. Strain the beans and add to a blender with 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Start to slowly blend adding more liquid if needed to make a smooth puree. Add the garlic cloves and continue to blend. Next slowly add in the garlic infused oil. This will slowly bring the puree into a smooth sauce. Finally add the lemon juice and adjust the salt and pepper as needed. This will store for 5 days in the fridge. I also top it with some olive oil when storing.</p>
<p><strong><u>Avocado- </u></strong>I just mash up with a fork and season with a little sea salt and lemon juice.</p>
<p><strong><u>Egg or Eggs </u></strong>– cook to your preference. I like sunny side up but this would be great with poached, scrambled, ect.</p>
<p><strong><u>Now to put it together- </u></strong>First Toast the grain bread in a pan with a small amount of butter. (or a Toaster) Next add the bean puree to the toast (around 4 Tablespoons) Add the avocado on top of the puree. Next I add a few sliced cherry tomatoes to add some acidity. Now top with your egg or eggs. and finish with some chopped chives and parsley.</p>

<p>This New England native may only stand at 5’1” but her ambitions and dreams are sky high. Becca PIzzi made history this year as the first American women to complete 7 marathons, in 7 days on 7 continents. You may be asking yourself, how and why did she do this?</p>
<p>It all started at the age of 6, when Becca first started running. Her Dad, a runner, was her inspiration, so naturally at the age of 7 Becca signed up for her first race and hasn’t stopped since. On top of averaging 70-100 miles a week in training runs, Becca has run a total of 52 total marathons, 15 of them being Boston, in 24 different states and on 7 different continents!</p>
<p>When Becca first heard about the World Marathon Challenge, she knew she wanted to compete in the event, and that is exactly what she did. She went from Antarctica, to South America, to North America to Europe to Africa, to Asia and finished out the challenge in Australia. The $36,000 trip, (that was covered mostly by sponsors) accounted for 59 hours in the air (10 hours a day), 24,000 miles in the air, 183 miles of running, eating at 33,000 ft. and averaging 7 hours a night of sleep in the lay-down beds on the plane. Despite the logistical and lifestyle challenges, Becca was able to pull off what no other American woman has done. She ran 7 marathons, in 7 days, on 7 continents in 27 hours, 26 minutes and 15 seconds!</p>

(Robin Lubbock)</p></div>
<p>Becca is a mom to a 7 year old daughter, owns her own daycare, manages an ice cream parlor and on top of all that, manages to make time for the sport she is most passionate about; running. Before the start of this #Extraordinary journey Becca said, “It was a mind game, you know, and I thought from day one, you’re going to have to get real comfortable being uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>In addition to her responsibilities as a mom and runner, Becca is passionate about running with the Boston Bulldogs. This co-ed group is a non-profit group that supports those battling addiction and those who are currently in recovery. Over the years this group has become a community of support encouraging physical, emotion, and social benefits of running and overall health.</p>
<p>So, what’s next for Becca? She says she’s going to take on an Ironman and complete her own 50 state marathon challenge. Becca has already crossed off 27 states!</p>
<p>Becca Pizzi runs in <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/womens-kismet-ii"">Newton Running Kismet II’s</a> and <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/women-gravity-v"">Newton Running Gravity V’s</a></p>

<p>It all started with a traffic accident that resulted in a broken back, leaving Marianne a paraplegic with walking function. At the age of 23, you are imagining a life with endless opportunity. You’re thinking about where to live, what career to pursue, but now all Marianne was left with was a life with limited choices. “I was comforting myself with a lot of food and keeping myself in that role by not doing anything.” Days were filled with sitting on the couch and lying in bed, eating. Before Marianne knew it, she had reached 302 lbs, was diagnosed with diabetes, developed high blood pressure and in a world of confusion. Using excuse after excuse to keep herself in the role of a victim, Marianne admitted, “I was trying to kill myself by eating myself to death.”</p>
<p>On a random night out with her dogs, Marianne challenged herself to run to the lamp-post that was just ahead, and she did. Running with the assistance of a cane, Marianne’s runs became longer, more frequent and have since become a part of her everyday life. She had finally found something that got her off the couch and brought joy to her life, and that is where her career as a paratriathlete began.</p>
<p>The next few months were a fast-paced adventure. Her first marathon happened in May 2012 in Copenhagen, where she finished in a time of 5:46:41. A few short months after solely focusing on running, Marianne began training for triathlons and quickly discovered she had an #Extraordinary talent in the sport. Early 2013, just months after adding swimming and biking to her routine, she was accepted onto the Danish national team and shortly after that was granted a Pro License in 2014 as the first Danish paratriathlete.</p>
<p>What’s next for Marianne? This year’s goal is to reclaim her World Championship title after winning both the ITU long distance and cross triathlon world championships in 2015. Marianne’s other focus for the year is to grow the paratriathlete community. She thrives off of stories of those in her community overcoming their own obstacles in a quest to be <strong>#Extraordinary</strong>. Marianne wants to continue to invite and challenge  others to experience the energy and motivation that comes with personal growth and competition. Marianne’s personal motto, “The essence of what I do is simply to be more than I was yesterday” couldn’t describe her life any better.</p>

<p>The life of an endurance athlete means constantly pushing your body and mind beyond limits, and that is the life that Van McCarty has chosen to live.  Motivated and inspired by his family, Van continues to push himself in race environments and see how he competes against others of all ages, at the age of 45!</p>
<p>With a full-time job, a wife and two kids, training comes whenever Van has time. A typical week consists of 18-22 hours of various methods of physical activity. Whether it’s biking, spinning, running or swimming, it just depends on the time of day that Van can find some free time.  Morning workouts typically consist of either a short interval day (400m-1k) or a longer interval day (1600-5k’s). Mid-day workouts consist of running and workouts after work don’t happen, that is the time of day for the kids’ activities! With plenty of “easy-days” in his workout regiment, Van rarely ever takes time off.</p>
<p>Van’s biggest accomplishment to date was completing his first Ironman in Coeur d’ Alene in 2005. After missing Kona qualifying time by just 5 minutes, this day marked a stepping stone for Van. He knew that if he focused on getting better and faster he could do anything – and that is exactly what he did. Since his first Ironman in 2005, Van has qualified for the Ironman World Championship in Kona 4x. But he’s not only dedicated to triathlon! Van has landed a first place overall finish in 5 different 50k trail races! With 113+ races, (16+ of them being ultras!) and 5,600+ race miles under his belt, Van’s racing history is an accomplishment in itself. “I just found running so enjoyable. Just how simple it was and I found out that I was pretty good at it and that got me excited to keep pushing, keep trying to get faster.”</p>
<p>Van continues to find motivation from seeing his race times improve over the past six to seven years. To do so, Van continues to find new ways to strategize his energy outputs when racing by focusing on his heart rate and honing in on his strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In addition to volunteering for his son’s swim club and daughter’s dance company, Van has a number of races on the calendar for the remainder of the year as he continues all of us to live and run an #Extraordinary life.</p>

<p>Brent Pease was a swimmer growing up but really got into fitness in 2007, losing 30 lbs along the way. His younger brother Kyle Pease was born with cerebral palsy, a condition that affects his speech and limits muscle mobility, but, sure doesn’t limit his dreams and ambitions.</p>
<p>When Brent finished his first Ironman in 2010, Kyle was mesmerized by the atmosphere at the race and thought to himself, “I should be able to participate in any sport or race like anyone else.” In February of 2011, Kyle’s dream came true. Brent pushed Kyle in a three-wheel wheelchair to the finish line of their first 10k together – but that was just the beginning of the Pease Brothers’ #Extraordinary racing adventures.</p>
<p>About 25 events later, the Pease brothers decided to take on the ultimate test of endurance racing: an Ironman. It was September 2013, in Madison, WI. Brent pushed, pedaled and pulled Kyle for 140 miles, making the motto of the Ironman “anything is possible” come to life.  “When I’m out there with Kyle sometimes I forget that there’s this extra weight. Kyle borrows my legs and I borrow his spirit and you know, that really helps us get through it,” says Brent.</p>
<p>The Pease brothers began racing together not only to fulfill Kyle’s dreams of partaking in races, but to inspire others with disabilities to pursue their dreams. Both Kyle and Brent know that adaptive equipment is costly, but feel that no child with a disability should be deprived of an activity they dream of doing. Founded by the brothers in 2011, the Kyle Pease Foundation provides assistance to families with disabilities for adaptive equipment, as well as promotes athletics within the disabled community. This #Extraordinary foundation has raised enough money to give scholarships to individuals for the last three years and has served over 60 families to date.</p>
<p>The Pease brothers continue to race and compete for their charity and continue to spread their philosophy on life that, “People with disabilities have no limits.”</p>

<p>We all have our own demons we fight every day. Today, 1 in 5 adults in the United States suffer from mental illness, self-harm or addiction dependency. Sophie Kashurba, a former collegiate cross-country runner at Gettysburg College was one of those people suffering.</p>
<p>Collegiate level cross-country athletes seek adrenaline rushes by pushing their bodies to the limit. For more than five years, Sophie got that endorphin rush not by pushing her body beyond its capabilities, but from cutting. An excelling athlete, honor student and all-around people pleaser, Sophie’s expectations for herself were set so high that there was never a sense of accomplishment or relief, except when cutting.  “Self harm just became a way of escaping, and also just a way of having something I could control.” By the time college came around, Sophie learned how to control the urge, how to release in a different way; she began running as a means of control, instead of cutting.</p>
<p>Then, Sophie embarked on an #Extraordinary physical and mental challenge. The Ice Breaker Run is a 24-day relay across the United States. Each team is comprised of six people all who have a history of mental illness. Sharing their stories of mental illness along the way, this group of men and women, including Sophie, took turns running the 3,100 miles to get them from Santa Monica, CA to Alexandira, Virginia, the location of the 2016 Mental Health America Conference.</p>
<p>Kashurba ended up running just under 600 miles of the 3,100 <a href=""http://www.newtonrunning.com/women-gravity-v"">in her Gravity V</a>‘s, but that wasn’t the difficult part. For Sophie, it was opening up about her story. “…being open and vulnerable only came after the first couple of times we met with people. I saw that if I was more open, other people would be willing to share their stories.” Sophie, at the age of 23, was the youngest on the team by 20+ years! She wanted to be that person to represent the younger generation and give those closer to her age someone to relate to. That is how Sophie took ownership and become an #Extraordinary member of the team.</p>
<p>She gives running the credit for her healing. “I am extremely thankful to be able to use my love of the sport to help empower others one stride at a time.” Before Sophie took on the Ice Breaker Run in June of this year, she had worked at <em>Running Works </em>from May ‘15- July ‘16, a non-profit organization that utilizes running and life skills as a healing process. Not only has Sophie realized that qualities gained from being part of the running population translates to a positive life, but those involved with <em>Running Works</em> have as well.</p>
<p>This #Extraordinary journey from self-harm to self-acceptance has made Sophie see that, “Life is easier when you know that you don’t have to be perfect.” Kashurba is heading to pursue a doctorate in Chiropractic’s at the University of Western States this year, while continuing to use running as a healing power and as her means of getting her through Badwater 135, her next #Extraordinary feat to conquer.</p>
